"Bought to use as a pc monitor; general email, excel, PowerPoint, and teams work.

Setup was easy, 2 screws each to attach the legs and it was standing up. The body is pretty thin and flexes, but under 2 bills it’s forgivable.

Turned it on and there’s no way to bypass smart features and signed onto Amazon with wifi and all. Needed to update so gave it a few min.

The remote has no input button so have to navigate via the fire home screen which is pretty annoying. After first use, there’s a stacked panes button remote that’s for recent favorites and does in a way act as an input button. Tv doesn’t remember which input you leave on and boots to fire Home Screen every time. Couple more button presses in the morning I guess.

Screen is more than bright enough for desk work, I actually turned down brightness as I’m sitting about 2.5 ft away. Tv doesn’t do 4:4:4 chroma so text is not perfect but perfectly serviceable after a few tweaks; setting picture mode to pc and turning on super resolution seems to do the trick for now. Most general office work has black text against white in excel, outlook, teams, etc. don’t expect it to give me trouble reading wise but am aware it wouldn’t be the best monitor for detailed graphics nor critical PowerPoint where accurate colors are required. Attaching pictures of general office work and rtings chroma test: most are perfectly legible except the lowest two rows where there is some blur but legible, I don’t expect to read text in those color schemes for general office work.

A few surprises, this is actually natively airplay compatible and HomeKit. Airplay is always nice to have for a quick screen share from phone and HomeKit integration means I have a spare remote on my phone and it helps with the input button annoyance.

There is a slight window pane effect sitting this close, the utmost outer edge where the scroll bar would sit for many applications has an odd 3D effect, like it’s floating. Looks a little funny but not a show stopper.

Love the screen productivity this affords, it’s literally 4 x 21.5” at 1080p each, and with quick windows shortcuts (win+left+up, etc) it’s really easy to snap windows into a 4 grid to multitask or cross reference data.

Or it can offer massive screen real estate for spreadsheets and multiple word pages.

Now let’s hope it lasts.

Update***
While screen sharpness and text was not an issue, after a full day of work decided to return, the input lag was disruptive. Would have been fine for general home theater pc use but the typing lag was not conducive for work where I’m constantly firing off emails and messages. The tcl 4 series is much better in this regard and what ive ordered instead now.",B08Z265BJH,43” pc monitor,Size: 43-inch,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Got this TV yesterday and it's great! Very snappy User Interface and Excellent picture quality all at a great price!

Standard is dull
Movie is too gray
Dynamic is too bright
Natural is too soft

You absolutely have to use the custom setting. To do so, open up an app and start watching a video. Then long press the home button on your remote. A side menu will reveal itself and scroll down to Picture.

Once you sign in with your Amazon account it basically just sets itself up. Picking it up from Best Buy was just as easy. Just show them your Amazon order number and they bring it right out to you. Honestly I wasn't expecting this great of picture quality from a TV under $300. I was pleasantly surprised.

"I use it for computer monitor, and the text is very sharp. You have an option of changing the type to PC.
I also use the computer to calibrate the text.
Other than that, some very minor negative:

1. It updates twice, meaning it can't get the latest and update. This is very minor.
2. It shows 4k youtube video in very good pictures, however, on some other video, the color is a bit off. It is very similar to when I compare Samsung $900 TV with $1700 TV. For $200 level monitor, it's a great deal.
3. The edges, when viewing close as a monitor, it reflects into the screen, and actually override the screen's edge, such as the scrollbar. This is a bit bigger issue. However, for $200 and very clear text, I would buy it again. Actually, I did, I bought one for my wife, then get another for myself.
4. The size is about perfect for monitor. The one it replaces is 48"", and I find myself having to move a bit left and right. When they make it curved (at low price), 48"" is probably fine.
5. This is not for game, at 4k, it works at 30 framerate, probably due to my computer, not the monitor, but it appears to support up to 60 frame per seconds. Still not for game, but not bad at all.

6. It has problem display some text not clearly, as black text in pink background, as seen in the attached picture. It is rare for many people to have this combination, but it's a minor problem anyway.

-The built in smart stuff is probably fine for most people, but I prefer Apple TV. I don't even have this thing connected to wifi because I don't want Amazon tracking everything I do (""he says, as he writes this review on Amazon..."") but I'm sure Best Buy is getting a kickback for the usage of Fire TV (Insignia is a Best Buy house brand, if you didn't know).
-Because I don't use the built in smart stuff, it complains every time I turn it on that it's not connected to Wifi or Amazon. I use HDMI-CEC to control it through the Apple TV though, so I only see this message for a few seconds before it switches over. Annoying, but that's it.
-It's a little bulkier than a nicer TV would be, but again...you probably aren't here because you expect the slimness of an LG C1 on a $300 set.

"I was definitely hesitant given the reviews, but so far so good with one minor hiccup. I can't seem to get it to recognize my PC via HDMI. The PC recognizes the TV, the TV recognizes that something is plugged in, but it says no signal detected no matter what I've tried. Restarts, resets, plugging and unplugging, different cords, etc. I feel like I might be missing something simple.

That is not a dealbreaker, however, because it functions surprisingly well as a Smart TV. It's quick, no major delays or funkiness. Huge huge upgrade from the smart tvs of yesteryear, if that's holding anyone back. I've seen a lot of people complain about the ads, but they're confined to the home menu. You're not getting ads during Netflix or anything.

Overall I'm pretty pleased with this purchase, having paid about $250 out the door. I don't really need another computer monitor, so purely calling this a TV, it seems great, but longevity will be the true test.

Edit: Fixed the issue by setting the HDMI to 1.4 instead of 2.0 and it started working, but glitchy. Looks like it was a combination of that setting and a right-angle adapter I had on the pc end of the cable.

"I found this during Prime Day, and got a hecka killer price. I wanted a Samsung, but alas its hard to find a 55"" Samsung model with all the features at a price I wanted.

I love the multiple HDMI hookups. You do not need a Firestick, so the one I have for my last TV is being used to hold papers down on my desk. The assembly was quick and easy. I am a senior and live alone so I was a bit worried that I might not be able to maneuver this out of the box and onto my TV stand, but I managed just fine. If you do unpack it alone, the easiest and safest thing to do is slide it out of the box onto your bed, hook up the legs [or stand if you go that direction], and hook up the power cord BEFORE you pick it up and put it down on the stand.

Wifi connection was a breeze, and the interface is just like the Firestick so its pretty easy to use and familiar to a veteran Firestick customer. Antenna driven TV was simple enough to add too, but I need to figure out if I can log into my Samsung account to get the on-air Samsung TV stuff.

"'TV constantly goes back to home screen randomly while using any streaming app. Can be in the middle of a movie and next thing you know, TV goes back to home screen and then you have to open the app and wait for it to load again, but then you have to find where you were interrupted yourself as the TV forgets where it was in that movie. Does it with Netflix, Hulu, Peacock, and Amazon Viedo. Also constantly have a notification that shows the little Android dude and it just says ""Music"" have factory reset the TV and everything and it randomly pops up too. Not worth it at all. Worst Amazon device made to date, although they truly didn't make it, Insignia did. Will NEVER EVER EVER buy INSIGNIA products ever again. Crap products with worse crappy customer service. Should have immediately sent this TV back for a refund!' - My original review August 2022.

Recent software update fixed these issues, my only issue with this version of software is that any commercial interruption while streaming video, will cause the audio and video to be out of sync with one another when the video restarts. The only fix for this is to go back to the Home screen, wait a few minutes and then relaunch the streaming app and restart your video, OR from the home page, click settings, then software, and restart the TV. PRESSING THE POWER BUTTON DOES NOT POWER DOWN THE TV, IT ONLY PUTS IT TO SLEEP (SAME AS YOUR PHONE, TAP IT AGAIN AND IT IS INSTANTLY READY...). So after every single commercial break, the video will be ahead of audio by about 5 seconds, as a lip reader due to hearing impairment, what audio I hear really makes me dizzy trying to focus on the mouth movements to interpret what is being spoken. I have partial loss in one ear, and 90% loss in the other, as a result of military trauma. I rely on reading lips to verify the majority of the sounds I think I hear, for instance, someone might say, ""Nice shoes"" and the sound is muffled by a fan blowing directly toward me, so I think I heard, ""screw you"", ""bless you"", ""who're you"", ""I hate blue"", ""where'sthe crew"", ""...few"", ""...knew"",...the list could go on endlessly. I read their lips and can instantly determine a ""nI-ssss SH-oohs"" by the lip position, and can reply correctly and thank them for the compliment instead of being offended, or my go-to when I can't determine what was said, ""well what do you think?"" to return the ball back in their court, like word tennis. Software updated 3 times and that is the only issue I can't get resolved.

I hate that I cannot delete those preloaded Amazon apps. Why? Because I have recently been getting error messages that my memory is almost full. Erm, what? I have installed only a handful (4 or 5?) apps like Xfinity, Netflix, Hulu, Showtime, Tubi so I can stream. It was a pain to find out how to delete apps. After I cleared out most of my apps, I STILL got the error message. I kept deleting and cleaning out cashes, etc. Finally, I no longer get the error message. Every once in a while, something blips on it and I have to turn off/turn on to fix. If you can put up with some little irritations every once in a while, then this is a great buy.

"When it comes to daily watching like in my living room my go to is samsung tvs. Bought this to replace a older TV in the bedroom . I wouldn't buy this for a living room personally.

"UPDATE 03/29/2022: (added stars)
Just wanted to update this review. Amazon Customer Service called me shortly after posting this review (wow! impressive timing) and we talked about setting expectations for the performance of this TV. The way it was explained to me: when the TV is used only about half an hour every day it caches data and has to sync up when finally turned on--this takes a little while to catch up and accurately reflects my experience with the TV.

I will stand by this product and say that it is still definitely worth the price paid--it does the job. I might not choose it as my main source of entertainment, but it more than fits the bill in our exercise room. We discussed an easy workaround to circumvent the performance issue: just unplug it when not in use, and this will improve the performance. Easy enough. Thanks again, and frankly I would certainly be tempted to recommend this product on the exceptional customer service, alone. Thanks, as always--happy to be an Amazon customer!!

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
So we bought this TV for the exercise room to pass time while working out. The TV sets up fine. Everything is ""mostly"" fine. I'm not going to review the Amazon software because, frankly, I don't know where one problem begins and the other ends. Confusing, huh? Here's the thing. The TV itself displays a picture--good enough for an exercise room--the sound is as-expected for being in the unit, etcetera.

The problem is with the user interface. Now I DO NOT WANT TO SPECULATE as my software engineering days are over, but right when the TV ""boots up"" it's pretty fast and responsive. However, given the course of about 3-5 hours of being TURNED OFF and plugged into the wall, when reactivated, the TV will become a very slow user experience. I have some network traffic monitors running against my router (i.e. WireShark / Solar Winds), and I see a large amount of wireless traffic coming from the TV when it's not in use. I'm not sure if this is normal or if it was hacked or what, but I just thought I'd let everyone know.

Disabling some of the targetted advertising cut this down a bit, and I have updated the firmware, but I just can't shake the suspicion that the reason for the slowness is either because the device's storage is filling up (with god-knows-what) or that the device is preoccupied with performing some other task. I have also disabled auto-updates for caching the installed applications (just Amazon Prime and YouTube right now). UX is still very slow after being plugged in for a while.

So we've taken to the habit of unplugging it and re-plugging it just before use. Might just leave it unplugged until we actually need it, but the last thing I want is to power it on, and have to wait while it catches up on all the updates.

Don't get me wrong, in concept, the TV is a great idea: integrated with online services, etc, but I just need more time to dig into the actual traffic being sent from it. Maybe a factory reset will help the speed, but I don't want to delete any proof of unoptimized code or anything. Definitely something I think the manufacturer should look into. ""Internet of Things"" devices are inherently insecure, so we rely upon these manufacturers to secure their devices as well as possible when welcoming them into our homes and networks.

I hope this helps your decision. Maybe best to keep it off the network until they can work out these bugs, but then what do you have? DVD/BLURAY TV? Very limited, and kind of defeats the purpose of getting a ""smart"" TV. Anyways, I'm babbling at this point.

"24"" model - unpacking easy but sticky tape around all edges of monitor, cellophane around batteries, sticky tape on remote and legs made it a bit of a trudge. Leg mounting screws were a pain - I don't know if my t.v. was an exception, or the rule - but the holes for the screws were not pre-tapped. Some pressure was required to fully seat all four screws; a good Philips screwdriver is recommended. (Watch the video that's on the Amazon page - you'll notice that the ""unboxing"" guy couldn't get the screws in either and an overlay in text on the video noted to ""Tighten the Screws"". There should be no wobble; wobble isn't for adjusting the t.v. pitch angle, it means the screws are not fully seated. Be careful - you don't want to strip the heads out on those little screws!

Once assembled setup of the t.v. proper was easy but tedious; WiFi connection resulted in a very slow download of apps and operating system - it took perhaps 30 minutes to complete everything. Of course, that will depend upon how many apps you have installed or want to install. My WiFi gives an excellent signal (I'm a retired I.T. tech), but Ethernet beats WiFi everytime so I hooked up an Ethernet cable and things perked up to almost acceptable. No mistake - this is a slow t.v.; I'd recommend Ethernet wherever available. I haven't hooked up a coax antenna yet, so cannot comment on over-the-air broadcast reception.

Sound quality goes right along with the price point of this unit - the price is low and so is the sound quality.

The picture is 720p - so don't expect much, no matter what the paid reviewer on the video reports.

I should note that I ""bought the price, not the t.v.""; I'm using this in my (very) small home office - there's no room on the desk for a second monitor and the Echo Home 8"" device just doesn't cut it for long term viewing of t.v. shows or movies. For my purpose, I'm finding this 24"" t.v. to be acceptable but not terrific. For a small bedroom, travel trailer with 110v available, kitchen, etc. I think this unit is O.K. Even for a kid's room, however, I'd be looking at the upgraded 2022 model for a few bucks more. My ""stars"" score takes into consideration the price point of this t.v. - I wasn't expecting a top-shelf television for this amount of money, and I got what I expected.

"UPDATE: (5 Stars)
.
7 months in and we've had zero problems with this TV. Our fiber internet provider updated the Wi-Fi equipment in our house and this Fire TV is now able to pick up a 160 mbps typical signal strength. The quality of the picture is actually slightly better close-up now, though from several feet away, it's just as good as before.
.
No complaints thus far - a worthy investment. Upping my rating for the trouble-free operation!

ORIGINAL REVIEW: (4 Stars)
.
I wanted to upgrade our 12- and 17-year-old TV's and have been researching all the options. I used rtingsdotcom to compare performance, as well as online reviews, and it wasn't easy. It seemed that unless you were spending big bucks, rtings always had issues.
In the end, I went for the 65"" Vizio M65Q7-JO1 for the main TV. The ratings were pretty good and the value seemed good at $699 with an OEM 3-year warranty from my local membership warehouse. So, far I've been very pleased with it.
This TV also allowed me to have a reference point for the rtings reviews. Knowing what they said about the Vizio compared with what I saw, I was able to use that to gauge other TV's against my needs.
.
These first gen Fire TV's aren't rated at all highly. However, when the 43 inch Fire TV was on sale for $259 with a free Echo Dot, I decided it was worth trying. The smaller TV is used almost exclusively by my wife to watch Food Network and HGTV (!) from a distance of about 13 ft. She doesn't care about smart features and sits almost square on to the TV, slightly down and to the right in a brightly (daylight) illuminated 'sunroom', just off the kitchen.
.
After unpacking the Fire TV, I immediately mounted it on a stand. (PERLESMITH Universal TV Stand - Table Top TV Stand for 37-55 inch LCD LED TVs). The included Fire TV feet would be too wide for the cabinet's shelf. The required mounting screws were already in the VESA mounting points, which was great! No searching around for the right thread and length screws.
.
On powering up the TV, Amazon had it all set up with my Wi-Fi password and Amazon account. Somewhat scary, but understandable, given that we have Echo Dots all around the house. So it automatically updated the firm- and soft-ware and was ready to go! The screen was looking good with no defects. Interestingly, the TV comes with just a short, get-up-and-run pamphlet, with no manual. I searched online and found a pdf, though, being an engineer, I was able to just go through the menus and quickly understand the systems. Other's might struggle. Vizio actually has the manual built into the TV's menu.
.
We use Chromecast with Google TV and stream YoutubeTV on both TV's, as well as my daughter's TV, while she's at college. I didn't even bother to check out the Fire TV apps and immediately installed the Chromecast.
I had trouble with the Chromecast remote. Google doesn't list 'Amazon' or 'Fire TV' as options for the remote codes. I knew from research that the Fire TV is a TCL rebrand and tried that remote code offering. It sort of worked but wasn't good enough. The volume was slow to respond, unless right up close to the TV. The power worked but didn't work to turn on the Chromecast once it had turned itself off. The input selection was also problematic. After much trial and error, I got the Chromecast remote working correctly using the settings shown in the photo.
I also found that I could connect the Fire TV remote to the Chromecast. There's a video on YT on that. The Fire TV remote connects via BT to the Chromecast by long pressing the HOME button to go into pairing mode. You do have to hold the remote right next to the Chromecast itself to get it to connect to the Fire TV remote. It'll come up as 'AR'. Once connected it works perfectly but has to be disconnected to do anything with the TV settings. In the end, I just disconnected it and use the Google remote.
.
I have found that my old TV's had much better reflection handling. Any reflections were very muted. The modern TV's all seem to be more reflective. The Fire TV is a little worse than the Vizio. You can see that in the photo. Fortunately, where my wife sits, the windows are out of view on the TV screen and it's only with a black screen that the reflections are an issue. On the Vizio, I keep the curtains drawn over the window directly behind me.
.
Brightness is as rtings said; not that bright. I found the best picture setting was DYNAMIC, with Cinema mode, Noise Reduction and Dynamic backlight OFF and standard white balance. This gives the brightest picture and the nicest color saturation. The TV works well in the room during the day. The Cinema mode resulted in a noticeable Soap Opera effect, which I don't like.
The display panel washes out very quickly as you view it off-center. At 40 degrees to the screen, the colors are not at all good and faces start to look a little gray. The Vizio is similar, but not as bad. Both are best viewed from directly in front.
.
With 4K content, the picture quality is actually pretty good. I have no complaints. However, really close up, you can see artifacts and a white ghosting around objects. This is especially noticeable on non-4K content, where the close-up image also seems out of focus, with lots of artifacts. However, from a 6ft distance, the image isn't bad.
I watched some old 1980's Bergerac episodes and the picture quality was quite acceptable with my picture settings.
I do see that news text on the screen is not as well defined as on the Vizio. In the photos, you can see the Fire TV letters' edges are rougher and less defined on the Fire TV compared with the albeit a larger and Quantum dot Vizio.
CONCLUSION:
If you are on a tight budget, I think the Amazon Fire TV is a viable option, but I certainly don't recommend you buy it above $280. There are likely better options out there for a few dollars more.",B08P3QB66R,"Good, if on a tight budget",Size: 43-inchConfiguration: TV only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Amazon Fire TV 43"" 4-Series 4K UHD smart TV.

Why I bought:
Price for 4K HDR 10 capability. Wanted to upgrade from a 1080p yard sale Samsung 32"" in the bedroom. Hard to beat 46% Prime day price reduction!

Pros:
Picture, (for the price) Atmos from Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video
Ultra clear picture even when sitting 3' from screen.
Firmware update fixed bright standby light issue (can now be turned off entirely, which is crucial for a bedroom TV).

Cons:
Hulu app won't do Atmos (yet). Picture is not nearly as good as high end 4K TVs, but still is decent in a darkened room. Fairly flimsy plastic legs are questionable supporting the weight of a VESA shelf and Canton metal center speaker. Like all Amazon gadgets, this kind of locks you into the Alexa/Fire ecosystem. I had to buy a new Yamaha surround receiver to work with the modern copy protection scheme all new 4k TVs have now.

Wish list:
As long as I'm wishing, Dolby Vision, better legs, NextGen ATSC 3.0 tuner. (What features it does have is nearly a miracle for the ultra low price though)

For Amazon:
Great first try into the entry-level 4K market. I'd love to see you top the available features in your follow-up to the 4- Series, while keeping the price low.

Biggest surprise:
How nice everything was at the price point.

Problems?
I installed too many apps at first, causing lag in the operating system. Better since I ""cleaned house."" Interface can glitch, leaving you with a blank screen or back at the home screen.

Value for money:
For 1/5th of of a grand on sale? You betcha!

Other thoughts:
If this is going into a very bright large room, or going to be viewed from extreme angles, you might want to spend more.
For my use in a dimmed, indirect lighting, direct view with a Yamaha Aventage 5.1.2 system for sound, It is the ideal bedroom setup. When viewed from 3 or 4 feet away, you get close to a movie theater experience, even with ""just"" a 43 inch screen.",B08P3QB66R,Great for the price,Size: 55-inchConfiguration: TV only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Mounting it was extremely easy (although I had my dad do it but he’s got all the carpenter’s tools; a stud finder, power drill and socket wrench set will do that). It’s very light for such a large TV but still pretty sturdy and well designed. It has more HDMI ports than most newer TVs out there, big bonus, as well as optical, USB and Ethernet ports.

As far as interface, super easy. I used Roku previously and this was not a huge leap. It connected to my Amazon account automatically and I had my three other streaming accounts hooked up in minutes. But it walks you though the usual setup the first time you power it on: language, all first time updates, a choice of apps or TV channel searching (can be skipped then added later) and then goes directly to the Home Screen where you can add what you like. Very simple and easy to understand. It doesn’t take forever to load when switching apps; it almost instantly just takes you to where you left off when switching between them. Absolutely love that feature. It does power down when idling on still screens too long but waking and resuming is quick too. The picture and audio settings are a breeze to tweak through the remote. The sound and picture are just right as well; the sound is crisp and balanced and the picture has easy defaults or can be customized. I always turn down the backlight because they always tend to be brighter than i like but it was simple to find. Switching to inputs or new apps is one-button; you don’t have to keep backing out to get to another quickly.

Honestly very impressed. I don’t need a lot of bells and whistles so I like when the things I do need a TV for are simple and seamless. It’s super easy switching between TV and three gaming consoles. Easy to add a HTML splitter and take advantage of more devices on one input if needed.

I’m the first person I know to get a Fire TV so it was a gamble, but it definitely paid off. Very worthwhile to get a mount if you feel confident installing it (you can always pay for installation if not). It’s a great TV to take advantage of newer game consoles. Personally, the Omni series had a bunch of stuff I didn’t need, so if you just need a TV for streaming and gaming, the 4-Series doesn’t disappoint.

On a side note, I saw some reviews about a ‘bright blue standby light’ that no longer exists as of this review. It’s a softer whitish light and not very bright. If a standby light does bother you at night, invest in black electrical tape. I’m not sure why people drop so many stars over minor personal issues. If you do happen to have pet peeves about electronics, it’s always best to research before you buy! And yes, companies do read reviews and see customer suggestions so nitpick away to improve their products. Either way, I have no complaints on what I ended up with.",B08P3QB66R,Liking it so far!,Size: 55-inchConfiguration: TV only,5.0 out of 5 stars
" We have a handful of TV options that I have upgraded over the last couple years. We have a 65"" LG C2 that is our go to and a 55"" Sony Bravia that is a close second. However, I needed to upgrade our bedroom TV and I needed something smaller and just couldn't bring myself to pay what I had paid for the others (both were well over 5x the asking price here.) When I found this TV for $299, I was skeptical but gave it a go. I have to say, I am pretty impressed overall. Here is what it is like to use:

The software is pretty quick. I attached a video so you can see it. Honestly, it is just as fast as either of our high end TV's and I think the menu is almost certainly better than the LG that is pretty messy. Alexa integration is good as well. All and all, finding something to watch on any streaming service (they are all here and available including AppleTV+) and switching up to regular TV is simple to navigate.

The picture is also pretty impressive to me. Both of our other TV's have much richer colors and deeper blacks. Watching this and than running down to the LG is especially telling. It isn't close. The LG is just brighter, crisper, and darker when it needs to be. That said, Amazon has a good screen here. I am no expert but the colors appear natural. The 4k here is very sharp. While only 60hz, for just regular TV, I don't miss the faster processing of the other TVs much. I did switch the picture from standard to ""movie bright"" which smooths things out a bit. I don't care for my movies and shows to all look like soaps. Just too realistic. Also, I was very concerned about sound here. Cheaper TVs tend to make a save here. Sound isn't rich but this TV gets loud. Plenty loud. No need for an additional sound bar unless you want to listen to music or really enhance your movies.

Overall, I am just really impressed by this TV. Like a lot of other Amazon tech (Fire tablets, ear buds, etc) this TV punches way above its price tag. While our other TV's are dynamite, I do question if they are worth the difference on price after this experience. It is also worth noting that Amazon has recently released a higher end Micro LED Fire TV that starts at $799. This also sounds like a good value but, for me, $300 for this 43"" is just a tremendous value. Buy with confidence. Well done Amazon!",B08P3QB66R,Not really a 5 star TV but definitely a 5 star value.,Size: 43-inchConfiguration: TV only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Wanted to replace the 43 inch TV in bedroom, as the viewing distance is longer and makes the smaller TV not as enjoyable. With the narrow border, this 55 fits where I felt I might need to stop at a 50 incher.

I immediately hated it and was ready to put back in the box and ship it back, but just took some setup and resetting as mentioned below. Seems like a keeper.

Well packaged (my older ones didn't come with a thick cardboard piece protecting the screen front, this one did, might be standard now).

Pulled old TV off the wall and removed the mount. Had to reuse the VESA mount screws as none are provided in the new TV. With it being much larger than old one, it weighs about half. Power and video connectors are on opposite sides, so had to do a little rewiring.

Once up on the wall and all plugged in, the fun begins. At least 30 minutes of updates once connected to WiFi. However remote is only about 20% functional, even after it got a 3 minute update. Find out how to re-initialize remote to TV, and it works better but TV doesn't think there is a remote. eventually after doing it a few times it sees the remote, and all buttons function.

Picture quality for HDMI input was very bad, and trying to change setup with remote not functioning was a trial. Once remote worked, I could go into setup and select Movie (auto was very bright, lots of compression artifacts) and it looks great.

This TV (I know, it is a FireTV) is very app/streaming centric, but once I found the setting to default to last input, and that is 99% of the time HDMI1, then it behaves like I want, turn on and display my input, not the apps home screen where I have to use the TVs remote to clear it and show input in HDMI1. I mainly use the remote for my satellite service, and rarely use the TV one, but since it is also the streaming apps, I will use it, and it adds yet another Alexa mic to do things from, TV related or not.

TV can be slow sometimes to turn on (it turns on reasonably, but doesn't show what is on the input for a while), again thought the remote was misbehaving again, it was just taking time to show anything.

Sound is better than old TV, none of them are real great, I do have a sound bar but I can use this TV with out for watching news and normal shows (not action movies or things with lots of audio like music).

I haven't tried casting to it (way easier to find stuff on a tablet with a keyboard then send it to the TV) and am getting my apps set back up, but the apps seem better than the FireTV stick, some of the video on Hulu stutters with it, not with the TV.",B08P3QB66R,"Took some tweaking, remote is not very responsive",Size: 55-inchConfiguration: TV only,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Purchase:

I purchased this TV based on the price and reviews as well as being part of the Amazon Fire family. I have had it set up for almost a week now and am enjoying it quite a bit.

Responsiveness:

My wife and I have used Amazon Fire TV devices for years now and it's nice not needing a stick or a cube to access the Fire interface. The menus are quick to load and responsive with content loading quickly and easily. (Note: this TV is used via ethernet connection in conjunction with 300Mbps download cable Internet).

Packaging:

Packaging was secure and kept the TV from damage in shipping. There was a small dent and tear in the box upon arrival but the 1 inch thick corrugated cardboard shield protecting the screen kept the TV from receiving any damage. The TV arrived within the 2 day Prime delivery time. The box was the store shelf box and was not a nondescript plain shipping box so anyone seeing the delivered TV would know what it was. Fortunately, my wife was at home to recieve the delivery so she asked the guy to place it in our garage for her.

Setup:

Setup was as easy as advertised. Connecting power and a few cables (ethernet, HDMI, HDMI eARC, etc.) and it was up and running. An update was downloaded and installed immediately and after a rapid automatic restart, the Amazon account setup opened on screen. Since we have an account, I just paired it to my account and selected to import all my account settings. Done and running.

I mounted the TV to a raised stand bracket we used for our previous TV and was pleased all my existing harware worked for the new TV. The mounting holes on the back of the TV fit with the universal mounting bracket I already had and the harware worked flawlessly. Bonus!

Sound:

I paired this TV with an Amazon suggested soundbar (Sony HTS100F 2.0ch) and was delighted with how easily they paired up and that the Amazon Fire remote controlled the soundbar immediately without any code cycling or other shenanigans. In fact, I didn't even bother to put the batteries in the Sound soundbar remote.

Picture:

Going from a 10 year old LCD 1080p TV to a 4K TV was a vast improvment in picture. I pulled up Disney+ and started Book of Boba Fett to see how it displayed the dark scenes in that first episode. After messing with the brightness and backlight settings a bit I had a picture I was extremely happy with. I checked the show info and saw I was watching in 2160p and marveled at the difference between my previous 1080p experience. With a 2TB data cap though, we'll have to watch our 4K streaming consumption.

Connections:

This TV has 3 dedicated HDMI ports and an HDMI eARC port. It has ethernet, USB, optical audio, etc.) I also use this TV with a home theater PC connected via HDMI and was delighted with the resolution upgrade while using the TV as a PC monitor.

A few snags:

1. On day 2 I was unable to get the TV to respond to the remote to turn on. I used the physical power button in the bottom middle of the TV to start it manually and the remote functioned fine after that. Since that, the remote has functioned flawlessly to turn on the TV. I have no idea what caused the initial issue.

2. I left the TV set to HDMI 1 (HTPC) when I shut it one night and the next day when I powered on the TV, the screen was flickering white noise and wouldn't bring up my Windows home screen. I used the home button on the remote to get back to Amazon's Fire interface and then switch back to HDMI 1 (HTPC) and had no issue with the picture. I have not been able to repeat this issue so am unsure what may have casued it.

Thoughts:

Despite a few odd snags, I have been extremely pleased with my experience with this TV so far. I belive the manufacturer is TCL and is considered a lower tier manufacturer but I haven't noticed any inferior features or quality in picture or sound. A wonderful experience on the whole. The two snags were the only thing keeping this from a 5 star review. I would say this is more like a 4 3/4 star review.",B08P3QB66R,Purchased to replace 10 year old Sony LCD,Size: 43-inchConfiguration: TV only,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm UPDATING my review, as Amazon's amazing outreach support team has saved the day. Apparently there IS a fix for the wavy picture, and the TV works perfectly fine now. The picture is great, functionality is great, sound is great, and it even looks great playing Zelda:BOTW on Switch. Now that the wavy picture is gone, this is an excellent TV for a great price. THANK YOU Amazon!

PREVIOUS REVIEW:
I ordered the first TV, then noticed that the picture would be wavy - most noticeably during dark scenes. It happened frequently, and became pretty annoying. Worked with the ""Fire TV department"" of Amazon's customer service, which was a nightmare - unlike ALL of my previous dealings with Amazon's standard customer service - and they sent another TV. This one did the exact same thing. At this point, I decided that it was more hassle to replace it (and they wanted me to return it, then pay almost $100 more to re-purchase the exact same TV!!), and I've decided to keep it as a bedroom TV. The rest of the functionality is fine as a secondary TV, so if you want to pretend that you're underwater or 'under the influence', then it's a good enough TV if you can get it at a discount (Prime Day, for example). Otherwise, save yourself the trouble and keep looking and get something that won't drive you mad.",B08P3QB66R,No more waves!,Size: 55-inchConfiguration: TV only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Got this for my gramms, she's 80, to replace a smaller 42"". She loved this because the closed caption was too small on her original set. Took a while to setup. Got her favorite show setup. All good. 11 pm, calling me in tears and frustration because Alexa did something to the channel, can't get the channel and another channel is playing in Spanish. 45 minutes to talk her thru getting back to hdmi input. 40 days of calls saying she's gonna throw the remote thru the screen because it keeps getting messed up, Even though it's a nice picture. Finally my brother disconnected it and put her old monitor with hdmi back to the xfinity box and she's been happy since. The set is great for features, but not seniors who get confused with electonics. Amazon should consider a Senior Mode, for people who have a set top box with hdmi, that let's you disable all the menus and options other than volume. The tv is still sitting in her hallway since i can't return it.",B08P3QB66R,Beautiful picture but not for seniors,Size: 50-inchConfiguration: TV only,5.0 out of 5 stars

"We set it up when we first got it in July and I noticed a very thin turquoise line but thought nothing of it as it seemed to be a good in the plastic screen cover and we put it away 5 min later. We placed it in the den closet in its box until we found a TV stand to match our furniture.
We FINALLY set it up on our new stand and the turquoise line was now accompanied by several lines of different colors. I've ordered 3 TVs from Amazon in a few months and THEY HAVE ALL BEEN CRACKED!!!
.....I really should have checked better.
It didn't initially look to be cracked but I can see how the blue line I first saw was the beginning of an INSIDE hairline crack that became worse.
Since we bought it on July and it's now Oct, I am out of the return period but since it was the inner screen that was defective the manufacture warranty covered it!

"The picture quality is stunning. You can literally see the actor's pores and wrinkles. The sound quality is great. The product itself is standard. Looks great, feels great. Nothing about it feels cheap or looks cheap. For $259 this 50"" TV was a steal. I'd totally recommend it. If you're not tech savvy, this might not be for you. I'll talk about it later.

Physically setting up the TV was super quick and straight-forward. As for the actual user experience/software, set up was also straight-forward and simple.

I will say that the FireTv interface is very spammy. There's a few sponsored banners on the home page. A lot of the recommendations are for Prime Video -- which I have -- but a lot of them aren't free with Prime. They're recommending me content that I have to buy /rent -- which makes it feel like I'm being advertised to. Amazon's self-promotion seems to be a common theme in their Fire lineup that just ruins the user experience. If this TV is for an older person, I'd worry that they would accidentally buy these movies and shows.

Luckily for me, I have an XFinity Flex box. If you can get your hands on a Roku, that's even better. (I don't recommend Google Chromecast). Simply plug your streaming device into the HDMI port. Now you have a cleaner interface plus a nice TV picture quality.

If you plan to use a streaming device instead of the FireTv interface, you have to alter your settings. Otherwise, everytime you power on your tv, it will go to the FireTv interface by default. Simply go to Settings > Display & Sounds > Power Controls > Power On >Last Input. Now, it will go to your streaming device on Power On.

All that said, do you really need to use a Roku or another streaming device? No. It's really easy to access HBO MAX, Netflix, or Disney+. It's easy to access your installed apps. If you don't care about aesthetics, you'll be fine. The home page is just busy, spammy, and overwhelming. If you can handle that, no streaming stick required.

Also, for people with Spectrum Tv, FireTv doesn't support a spectrum app. If that's a deal breaker, dont get it.

Also, if want to get the FireTv today, you can get it at Best Buy. Best Buy will price match Amazon products (sold by Amazon; prices set by third party sellers aren't eligible for price match).

Overall, I do recommend this TV. At its price point, it's a steal. If I had a reason to, I'd totally get more. Though next time, I'd probably aim for a bigger size.",B08P3QB66R,HONEST REVIEW FOR EVERYONE,Size: 50-inchConfiguration: TV only,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I waited several months before writing a review. We purchased this back in Prime Days and use the TV for several hours a day both for streaming and regular cable (ugh). We also have a DVD player attached for DVD/Blu-ray.

The Pro's- This is 100% out of the box ready to go. We did not wall mount and it sits on a console table. The picture is clear, its immediately tuned in and ready to go once you turn it on. Its also fast to switch between streaming and voice controls almost immediately respond. Arrived liked to my amazon account and ready to go.

The cons- this teeny tiny remote- seriously? The remote is 1/2 the size of an iphone and slippery. I bought a cover and its still a disaster. Needs more HDMI/USB ports.

I've not had any screen issues, any power issues, in 3 months of constant use its doing exactly what a TV should do-",B08P3QB66R,"Best value, easy to use and set up,",Size: 50-inchConfiguration: TV only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"We hunted for a tv for months, but didn't want a smart tv. Tried two non-Smart ones, for tv only , and were very disappointed in just about every aspect, from picture quality to sound to set up.

Finally decided to try this Fire TV at such a great price point. But figured that it would be disappointing.

What a wonderful surprise! The set up was incredibly easy. Carefully packed, perfect condition, the legs and remote in the top of the styrofoam and tv easy to remove. Unlike the others, this one was light, even in the good packaging. (43"" was the perfect size for our room).

We started by just setting up for tv, no internet, no apps. It was so quick and easy-- Basically, ""no, no, okay."" Manual only; we didn't want Alexa and that was fine. It worked great--looked perfect, sound quality was good , no distortion or buzzing and volume at 50% was already very good I don't know why anyone complained it couldn't go loud enough. The settings are easy to adjust (we get rid of ""action/motion smoothness"" but didn't really need to adjust brightness, color, etc. All really good, right out of the box.

A few days later, we set up the rest. Again, so easy! Wireless network--quick and easy, no problem with password. Tried it without signing into Amazon account---again, like with just using it as a tv--that was a definite option, to use it without linking them.

Then to Amazon sign in which also was quick and easy. Activating the apps, using it for everything we wanted--streaming, Prime videos, Youtube, tv...it all worked so well, far beyond what we expected. When you figure in the price, it's really an amazing deal. The pixel-peeper in the house couldn't even find anything wrong with the picture quality; likewise with the sound. 1080 HD and 720 SD both looked great--noticeably better with higher resolution, but still good either way -- haven't tried 4K (or Ultra 4k) yet, but may upsate afterwards. (Max res supposedly 3840 x 2860, but haven't tried it.) We're really happy
as is. (And all so easy, includng navigation.)

This is a fantastic value. Highly recommended.",B08P3QB66R,So happy!,Size: 43-inchConfiguration: TV only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I don't like how the notifications always come on in main screen. Mainly the music app as I have disabled all notifications including music. It's a clear TV. 4k not so much. I've ran it through video tests and it's rough. Good thing, it turns on, and it's clear. It's not a Sony so don't expect jaw dropping picture. I do approve this TV.

"I was one of the fortunate ones who got this TV during Amazon Prime Days for $99.99. It was delivered quickly and extremely well packaged, box & tv undamaged. I had a neighbor friend help me get it out of the box and set it up on my bedroom dresser. The TV is HUGE. I have over the air TV (no cable or satellite service) intentionally; I refuse to pay for TV when there is so much to watch for free. I purchased a $20 indoor antenna for the TV as well and hooked it up to the coax input on the back of the TV. Plugged the tv into a surge protected outlet. Placed the batteries in the remote. Turned on the TV using the remote. Setup could not have been easier....the TV did it all itself. Went through several updates, including updating the remote. Found my internet connection and Prime account; everything went beautifully! When the apps popped up on the TV, the picture was outstanding! The sound is no problem for me at all and is fine for my needs without a soundbar. I have it set to about 27. The remote whisked through all of the apps quickly and efficiently. Scanned for over the air channels and found 69, including all of my favorites! My neighbor was so impressed, she turned to me and said, ""how much did you pay for this again?"" I told her and she said I am so jealous...you got one heck of a deal. Look at that picture! I said I am very, very happy! I don't understand the complaints about the blue standby light. It is not very bright at all, non-intrusive and not nearly like a night light; if it bothers you, put tape over it! While I was watching, a pop-up in the right bottom corner came up and told me my Amazon order delivery had just arrived! Wow! The best feature is the Guide, that brings up a screen similar to what I have seen on cable company menus. It shows all of the terrific programming, channels and show times....what a great feature. For me,, this TV is an outstanding value and it exceeded all of my expectations. So glad I got it!",B08P3QB66R,Exceeded expectations; wonderful TV!,Size: 50-inchConfiguration: TV only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Tv works great when you first get it. Easy to set up, difficult to maintain. Remote failed after 2 months and alexa still doesnt work. I paid for convienience and having to repair the remote it came with just to turn the tv on or off (there is no other way) is a huge problem. After troubleshooting a device only 2 months of use and things are failing, my next tv will not be a firetv due to the frustration of constantly having to reset it up. My alexa button doesnt work and there are no clear instructions how to fix it but a factory reset. Very well maintained home, this product seems just designed to fail.

UPDATE** (9/7/2022) A customer outreach rep. Actually called me today about my review. They never asked any personal information and never will, just for you to verify the information they have is correct. This is awesome customer service. The call came from an unknown number from Washington D.C. (200 area code). They tried to help troubleshoot the issue with the remote, agreed it was defective, and immediately sent out a replacement at no charge. My review upgraded due to the fact i felt as Amazon wanted me to be satisfied with my purchase. Review will be updated upon arrival with a completely working remote.

UPDATE** replacement remote arrived in refurbished condition. The remote worked without having to set it up with the exception of the Alexa button again. Although, when i went into the pair settings, this remote connected right away. I was instructed to dispose of the old remote properly from Amazon outreach team. I saved it for a back up.

"I bought this 55"" TV on Prime Day for $285. For that price, this TV is amazing! If you must pay the full price, I would look elsewhere because there are better TV's for the money. That being said, I am extremely impressed with the picture quality. I am not a TV snob. I have never owned a high-end TV, so I cannot really speak to how it compares to the OLED TV's on the market. The TV that this replaced was a 7-year-old Insignia 1080p 50"". I think, for the general consumer, this TV is more than adequate.

I did not really like the Fire TV OS that came built into this TV. I am already part of the Google Assistant ecosystem. I have Google Assistant speakers and a few Nest Hub's around my house already. As well as a Nest thermostat. I gave the Fire TV OS a fair try, but I really just prefer the Chromecast with Google TV that I was using previously. The one thing I really liked about the Fire TV OS was the live TV guide. It gives all my OTA channels a nice guide just as if it were cable. Plus, it integrates all my streaming channels from lots of different sources. I think that is probably the only thing I will continue to use the Fire OS for.

The speakers on this TV don't sound that great. They are passible, and they sound better than the ones on the TV in my bedroom. I would still highly recommend a sound bar. Fortunately, we already had a Vizio 3.1.2 sound bar. I was able to connect it to the TV with the HDMI eARC port and it works flawlessly.

In conclusion, I would highly recommend this TV to anyone. It has great picture quality and some cool features for the money. Especially if you can purchase it for a discount like I did. Perhaps, if you must pay the full price, shop around and compare with some other options.",B08P3QB66R,Great TV for the money when you get it on sale,Size: 50-inchConfiguration: TV only,4.0 out of 5 stars
"So far I have had this TV for about four days, ordered it on Prime Day and received it about the next Friday after and I got this delivered to me during the early morning hours. Usually Amazon Prime delivers during the afternoon around my area so when I got a notification that morning that it was already delivered at six am surprised me as I found it sitting in front of the doorstep. So it was delivered early as it was suppose to be delivered on Saturday but I got it a day earlier. Overall, setting this up was pretty simple, I booted it up and apparently it needed to update right out of the box so I let it update which took about an hour but shortly after that getting all the apps that I use onto the TV was pretty simple as well. The picture quality on the TV is pretty good, I think a soundbar isn't really needed as the sound the TV provides is pretty good as well.

I have a PS5 and so gaming on this TV is pretty cool. It even switches to a gaming type mode of picture quality when you switch to the HDMI that has your PS5 Connected to which is unique because on my PlayStation 5 when I used on that TV it didn't do that at all and I would have to manually do it from the TV but with the Amazon Fire TV I didn't have to configure anything at all as it switched to that kind of pictured mode. My only problem, which it can be the TV itself or the HDMI Cable I have connected to the Cable Box is that at times it would flicker for a second and then stop, but do it again after awhile. When I'm always gaming, this is never an issue though so it could just be the HDMI Cable that could use a replacement. Overall, I am pretty much glad I got this at such an amazing price and maybe I'll use this TV for a good while.",B08P3QB66R,My Almost One Week Review Of Using This Amazon Fire TV.,Size: 43-inchConfiguration: TV only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I took advantage of prime day and bought the 55"" version of this TV. I was replacing a 37"" on the wall. The installation was easy, and when first starting up (I associated it with my amazon account when purchasing) it auto-updated a couple of times and kept restarting to do it, but after about 15 minutes was up and ready to go. I played with some of the built in apps and guide and they are pretty cool and work well. I tried airplay from both my iphone and Mac and it works great -- just like an apple TV. I use Tivo, and to get the Tivo remote to work with this TV, I had to use ""Element"" as the brand (so to those reviews where they said the TV is not in the list of other products, use ""Element."" One review complained that the TV always started on the homescreen when turned on, and not the video input they want (HDMI1) You can set it the way you want, but you have to go into settings, picture, power-on options and you can choose home or use last video input used. This way it stays on the cable box etc. The Alexa feature is cool and works, but I really don't use it. One of the reviews complained about not using standard screw sizes for wall mount.. This is not valid.. I ran into a similar issue as I was going from a 37"" to a 55"" and the screw sizes for these size sets are different where one uses M4 vs M6 screws... Any wall mount kit will have the correct size screws included with it, and even if you are replacing an older smaller set like me and have lost the rest of the screws, I went to home depot and they sell them there as M6 in various lengths...

Second, the default return shipping label is not pre-paid, but an easy call with the Amazon rep fixed that. Finally, I love the TV and its controls.

"UPDATE: (5 Stars)
.
7 months in and we've had zero problems with this TV. Our fiber internet provider updated the Wi-Fi equipment in our house and this Fire TV is now able to pick up a 160 mbps typical signal strength. The quality of the picture is actually slightly better close-up now, though from several feet away, it's just as good as before.
.
No complaints thus far - a worthy investment. Upping my rating for the trouble-free operation!

ORIGINAL REVIEW: (4 Stars)
.
I wanted to upgrade our 12- and 17-year-old TV's and have been researching all the options. I used rtingsdotcom to compare performance, as well as online reviews, and it wasn't easy. It seemed that unless you were spending big bucks, rtings always had issues.
In the end, I went for the 65"" Vizio M65Q7-JO1 for the main TV. The ratings were pretty good and the value seemed good at $699 with an OEM 3-year warranty from my local membership warehouse. So, far I've been very pleased with it.
This TV also allowed me to have a reference point for the rtings reviews. Knowing what they said about the Vizio compared with what I saw, I was able to use that to gauge other TV's against my needs.
.
These first gen Fire TV's aren't rated at all highly. However, when the 43 inch Fire TV was on sale for $259 with a free Echo Dot, I decided it was worth trying. The smaller TV is used almost exclusively by my wife to watch Food Network and HGTV (!) from a distance of about 13 ft. She doesn't care about smart features and sits almost square on to the TV, slightly down and to the right in a brightly (daylight) illuminated 'sunroom', just off the kitchen.
.
After unpacking the Fire TV, I immediately mounted it on a stand. (PERLESMITH Universal TV Stand - Table Top TV Stand for 37-55 inch LCD LED TVs). The included Fire TV feet would be too wide for the cabinet's shelf. The required mounting screws were already in the VESA mounting points, which was great! No searching around for the right thread and length screws.
.
On powering up the TV, Amazon had it all set up with my Wi-Fi password and Amazon account. Somewhat scary, but understandable, given that we have Echo Dots all around the house. So it automatically updated the firm- and soft-ware and was ready to go! The screen was looking good with no defects. Interestingly, the TV comes with just a short, get-up-and-run pamphlet, with no manual. I searched online and found a pdf, though, being an engineer, I was able to just go through the menus and quickly understand the systems. Other's might struggle. Vizio actually has the manual built into the TV's menu.
.
We use Chromecast with Google TV and stream YoutubeTV on both TV's, as well as my daughter's TV, while she's at college. I didn't even bother to check out the Fire TV apps and immediately installed the Chromecast.
I had trouble with the Chromecast remote. Google doesn't list 'Amazon' or 'Fire TV' as options for the remote codes. I knew from research that the Fire TV is a TCL rebrand and tried that remote code offering. It sort of worked but wasn't good enough. The volume was slow to respond, unless right up close to the TV. The power worked but didn't work to turn on the Chromecast once it had turned itself off. The input selection was also problematic. After much trial and error, I got the Chromecast remote working correctly using the settings shown in the photo.
I also found that I could connect the Fire TV remote to the Chromecast. There's a video on YT on that. The Fire TV remote connects via BT to the Chromecast by long pressing the HOME button to go into pairing mode. You do have to hold the remote right next to the Chromecast itself to get it to connect to the Fire TV remote. It'll come up as 'AR'. Once connected it works perfectly but has to be disconnected to do anything with the TV settings. In the end, I just disconnected it and use the Google remote.
.
I have found that my old TV's had much better reflection handling. Any reflections were very muted. The modern TV's all seem to be more reflective. The Fire TV is a little worse than the Vizio. You can see that in the photo. Fortunately, where my wife sits, the windows are out of view on the TV screen and it's only with a black screen that the reflections are an issue. On the Vizio, I keep the curtains drawn over the window directly behind me.
.
Brightness is as rtings said; not that bright. I found the best picture setting was DYNAMIC, with Cinema mode, Noise Reduction and Dynamic backlight OFF and standard white balance. This gives the brightest picture and the nicest color saturation. The TV works well in the room during the day. The Cinema mode resulted in a noticeable Soap Opera effect, which I don't like.
The display panel washes out very quickly as you view it off-center. At 40 degrees to the screen, the colors are not at all good and faces start to look a little gray. The Vizio is similar, but not as bad. Both are best viewed from directly in front.
.
With 4K content, the picture quality is actually pretty good. I have no complaints. However, really close up, you can see artifacts and a white ghosting around objects. This is especially noticeable on non-4K content, where the close-up image also seems out of focus, with lots of artifacts. However, from a 6ft distance, the image isn't bad.
I watched some old 1980's Bergerac episodes and the picture quality was quite acceptable with my picture settings.
I do see that news text on the screen is not as well defined as on the Vizio. In the photos, you can see the Fire TV letters' edges are rougher and less defined on the Fire TV compared with the albeit a larger and Quantum dot Vizio.
CONCLUSION:
If you are on a tight budget, I think the Amazon Fire TV is a viable option, but I certainly don't recommend you buy it above $280. There are likely better options out there for a few dollars more.",B08SVZ775L,delivery,Size: 32-inchStyle: HD,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Amazon Fire TV 43"" 4-Series 4K UHD smart TV.

Why I bought:
Price for 4K HDR 10 capability. Wanted to upgrade from a 1080p yard sale Samsung 32"" in the bedroom. Hard to beat 46% Prime day price reduction!

Pros:
Picture, (for the price) Atmos from Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video
Ultra clear picture even when sitting 3' from screen.
Firmware update fixed bright standby light issue (can now be turned off entirely, which is crucial for a bedroom TV).

Cons:
Hulu app won't do Atmos (yet). Picture is not nearly as good as high end 4K TVs, but still is decent in a darkened room. Fairly flimsy plastic legs are questionable supporting the weight of a VESA shelf and Canton metal center speaker. Like all Amazon gadgets, this kind of locks you into the Alexa/Fire ecosystem. I had to buy a new Yamaha surround receiver to work with the modern copy protection scheme all new 4k TVs have now.

Wish list:
As long as I'm wishing, Dolby Vision, better legs, NextGen ATSC 3.0 tuner. (What features it does have is nearly a miracle for the ultra low price though)

For Amazon:
Great first try into the entry-level 4K market. I'd love to see you top the available features in your follow-up to the 4- Series, while keeping the price low.

Biggest surprise:
How nice everything was at the price point.

Problems?
I installed too many apps at first, causing lag in the operating system. Better since I ""cleaned house."" Interface can glitch, leaving you with a blank screen or back at the home screen.

Value for money:
For 1/5th of of a grand on sale? You betcha!

Other thoughts:
If this is going into a very bright large room, or going to be viewed from extreme angles, you might want to spend more.
For my use in a dimmed, indirect lighting, direct view with a Yamaha Aventage 5.1.2 system for sound, It is the ideal bedroom setup. When viewed from 3 or 4 feet away, you get close to a movie theater experience, even with ""just"" a 43 inch screen.",B08SVZ775L,"Good, if on a tight budget",Size: 32-inchStyle: HD,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Mounting it was extremely easy (although I had my dad do it but he’s got all the carpenter’s tools; a stud finder, power drill and socket wrench set will do that). It’s very light for such a large TV but still pretty sturdy and well designed. It has more HDMI ports than most newer TVs out there, big bonus, as well as optical, USB and Ethernet ports.

As far as interface, super easy. I used Roku previously and this was not a huge leap. It connected to my Amazon account automatically and I had my three other streaming accounts hooked up in minutes. But it walks you though the usual setup the first time you power it on: language, all first time updates, a choice of apps or TV channel searching (can be skipped then added later) and then goes directly to the Home Screen where you can add what you like. Very simple and easy to understand. It doesn’t take forever to load when switching apps; it almost instantly just takes you to where you left off when switching between them. Absolutely love that feature. It does power down when idling on still screens too long but waking and resuming is quick too. The picture and audio settings are a breeze to tweak through the remote. The sound and picture are just right as well; the sound is crisp and balanced and the picture has easy defaults or can be customized. I always turn down the backlight because they always tend to be brighter than i like but it was simple to find. Switching to inputs or new apps is one-button; you don’t have to keep backing out to get to another quickly.

Honestly very impressed. I don’t need a lot of bells and whistles so I like when the things I do need a TV for are simple and seamless. It’s super easy switching between TV and three gaming consoles. Easy to add a HTML splitter and take advantage of more devices on one input if needed.

I’m the first person I know to get a Fire TV so it was a gamble, but it definitely paid off. Very worthwhile to get a mount if you feel confident installing it (you can always pay for installation if not). It’s a great TV to take advantage of newer game consoles. Personally, the Omni series had a bunch of stuff I didn’t need, so if you just need a TV for streaming and gaming, the 4-Series doesn’t disappoint.

On a side note, I saw some reviews about a ‘bright blue standby light’ that no longer exists as of this review. It’s a softer whitish light and not very bright. If a standby light does bother you at night, invest in black electrical tape. I’m not sure why people drop so many stars over minor personal issues. If you do happen to have pet peeves about electronics, it’s always best to research before you buy! And yes, companies do read reviews and see customer suggestions so nitpick away to improve their products. Either way, I have no complaints on what I ended up with.",B08SVZ775L,Great for the price,Size: 32-inchStyle: HD,5.0 out of 5 stars
" We have a handful of TV options that I have upgraded over the last couple years. We have a 65"" LG C2 that is our go to and a 55"" Sony Bravia that is a close second. However, I needed to upgrade our bedroom TV and I needed something smaller and just couldn't bring myself to pay what I had paid for the others (both were well over 5x the asking price here.) When I found this TV for $299, I was skeptical but gave it a go. I have to say, I am pretty impressed overall. Here is what it is like to use:

The software is pretty quick. I attached a video so you can see it. Honestly, it is just as fast as either of our high end TV's and I think the menu is almost certainly better than the LG that is pretty messy. Alexa integration is good as well. All and all, finding something to watch on any streaming service (they are all here and available including AppleTV+) and switching up to regular TV is simple to navigate.

The picture is also pretty impressive to me. Both of our other TV's have much richer colors and deeper blacks. Watching this and than running down to the LG is especially telling. It isn't close. The LG is just brighter, crisper, and darker when it needs to be. That said, Amazon has a good screen here. I am no expert but the colors appear natural. The 4k here is very sharp. While only 60hz, for just regular TV, I don't miss the faster processing of the other TVs much. I did switch the picture from standard to ""movie bright"" which smooths things out a bit. I don't care for my movies and shows to all look like soaps. Just too realistic. Also, I was very concerned about sound here. Cheaper TVs tend to make a save here. Sound isn't rich but this TV gets loud. Plenty loud. No need for an additional sound bar unless you want to listen to music or really enhance your movies.

Overall, I am just really impressed by this TV. Like a lot of other Amazon tech (Fire tablets, ear buds, etc) this TV punches way above its price tag. While our other TV's are dynamite, I do question if they are worth the difference on price after this experience. It is also worth noting that Amazon has recently released a higher end Micro LED Fire TV that starts at $799. This also sounds like a good value but, for me, $300 for this 43"" is just a tremendous value. Buy with confidence. Well done Amazon!",B08SVZ775L,Liking it so far!,Size: 32-inchStyle: HD,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Wanted to replace the 43 inch TV in bedroom, as the viewing distance is longer and makes the smaller TV not as enjoyable. With the narrow border, this 55 fits where I felt I might need to stop at a 50 incher.

I immediately hated it and was ready to put back in the box and ship it back, but just took some setup and resetting as mentioned below. Seems like a keeper.

Well packaged (my older ones didn't come with a thick cardboard piece protecting the screen front, this one did, might be standard now).

Pulled old TV off the wall and removed the mount. Had to reuse the VESA mount screws as none are provided in the new TV. With it being much larger than old one, it weighs about half. Power and video connectors are on opposite sides, so had to do a little rewiring.

Once up on the wall and all plugged in, the fun begins. At least 30 minutes of updates once connected to WiFi. However remote is only about 20% functional, even after it got a 3 minute update. Find out how to re-initialize remote to TV, and it works better but TV doesn't think there is a remote. eventually after doing it a few times it sees the remote, and all buttons function.

Picture quality for HDMI input was very bad, and trying to change setup with remote not functioning was a trial. Once remote worked, I could go into setup and select Movie (auto was very bright, lots of compression artifacts) and it looks great.

This TV (I know, it is a FireTV) is very app/streaming centric, but once I found the setting to default to last input, and that is 99% of the time HDMI1, then it behaves like I want, turn on and display my input, not the apps home screen where I have to use the TVs remote to clear it and show input in HDMI1. I mainly use the remote for my satellite service, and rarely use the TV one, but since it is also the streaming apps, I will use it, and it adds yet another Alexa mic to do things from, TV related or not.

TV can be slow sometimes to turn on (it turns on reasonably, but doesn't show what is on the input for a while), again thought the remote was misbehaving again, it was just taking time to show anything.

Sound is better than old TV, none of them are real great, I do have a sound bar but I can use this TV with out for watching news and normal shows (not action movies or things with lots of audio like music).

I haven't tried casting to it (way easier to find stuff on a tablet with a keyboard then send it to the TV) and am getting my apps set back up, but the apps seem better than the FireTV stick, some of the video on Hulu stutters with it, not with the TV.",B08SVZ775L,Not really a 5 star TV but definitely a 5 star value.,Size: 24-inchStyle: HD DTS TruSurround,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Purchase:

I purchased this TV based on the price and reviews as well as being part of the Amazon Fire family. I have had it set up for almost a week now and am enjoying it quite a bit.

Responsiveness:

My wife and I have used Amazon Fire TV devices for years now and it's nice not needing a stick or a cube to access the Fire interface. The menus are quick to load and responsive with content loading quickly and easily. (Note: this TV is used via ethernet connection in conjunction with 300Mbps download cable Internet).

Packaging:

Packaging was secure and kept the TV from damage in shipping. There was a small dent and tear in the box upon arrival but the 1 inch thick corrugated cardboard shield protecting the screen kept the TV from receiving any damage. The TV arrived within the 2 day Prime delivery time. The box was the store shelf box and was not a nondescript plain shipping box so anyone seeing the delivered TV would know what it was. Fortunately, my wife was at home to recieve the delivery so she asked the guy to place it in our garage for her.

Setup:

Setup was as easy as advertised. Connecting power and a few cables (ethernet, HDMI, HDMI eARC, etc.) and it was up and running. An update was downloaded and installed immediately and after a rapid automatic restart, the Amazon account setup opened on screen. Since we have an account, I just paired it to my account and selected to import all my account settings. Done and running.

I mounted the TV to a raised stand bracket we used for our previous TV and was pleased all my existing harware worked for the new TV. The mounting holes on the back of the TV fit with the universal mounting bracket I already had and the harware worked flawlessly. Bonus!

Sound:

I paired this TV with an Amazon suggested soundbar (Sony HTS100F 2.0ch) and was delighted with how easily they paired up and that the Amazon Fire remote controlled the soundbar immediately without any code cycling or other shenanigans. In fact, I didn't even bother to put the batteries in the Sound soundbar remote.

Picture:

Going from a 10 year old LCD 1080p TV to a 4K TV was a vast improvment in picture. I pulled up Disney+ and started Book of Boba Fett to see how it displayed the dark scenes in that first episode. After messing with the brightness and backlight settings a bit I had a picture I was extremely happy with. I checked the show info and saw I was watching in 2160p and marveled at the difference between my previous 1080p experience. With a 2TB data cap though, we'll have to watch our 4K streaming consumption.

Connections:

This TV has 3 dedicated HDMI ports and an HDMI eARC port. It has ethernet, USB, optical audio, etc.) I also use this TV with a home theater PC connected via HDMI and was delighted with the resolution upgrade while using the TV as a PC monitor.

A few snags:

1. On day 2 I was unable to get the TV to respond to the remote to turn on. I used the physical power button in the bottom middle of the TV to start it manually and the remote functioned fine after that. Since that, the remote has functioned flawlessly to turn on the TV. I have no idea what caused the initial issue.

2. I left the TV set to HDMI 1 (HTPC) when I shut it one night and the next day when I powered on the TV, the screen was flickering white noise and wouldn't bring up my Windows home screen. I used the home button on the remote to get back to Amazon's Fire interface and then switch back to HDMI 1 (HTPC) and had no issue with the picture. I have not been able to repeat this issue so am unsure what may have casued it.

Thoughts:

Despite a few odd snags, I have been extremely pleased with my experience with this TV so far. I belive the manufacturer is TCL and is considered a lower tier manufacturer but I haven't noticed any inferior features or quality in picture or sound. A wonderful experience on the whole. The two snags were the only thing keeping this from a 5 star review. I would say this is more like a 4 3/4 star review.",B08SVZ775L,"Took some tweaking, remote is not very responsive",Size: 24-inchStyle: HD DTS TruSurround,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm UPDATING my review, as Amazon's amazing outreach support team has saved the day. Apparently there IS a fix for the wavy picture, and the TV works perfectly fine now. The picture is great, functionality is great, sound is great, and it even looks great playing Zelda:BOTW on Switch. Now that the wavy picture is gone, this is an excellent TV for a great price. THANK YOU Amazon!

PREVIOUS REVIEW:
I ordered the first TV, then noticed that the picture would be wavy - most noticeably during dark scenes. It happened frequently, and became pretty annoying. Worked with the ""Fire TV department"" of Amazon's customer service, which was a nightmare - unlike ALL of my previous dealings with Amazon's standard customer service - and they sent another TV. This one did the exact same thing. At this point, I decided that it was more hassle to replace it (and they wanted me to return it, then pay almost $100 more to re-purchase the exact same TV!!), and I've decided to keep it as a bedroom TV. The rest of the functionality is fine as a secondary TV, so if you want to pretend that you're underwater or 'under the influence', then it's a good enough TV if you can get it at a discount (Prime Day, for example). Otherwise, save yourself the trouble and keep looking and get something that won't drive you mad.",B08SVZ775L,Purchased to replace 10 year old Sony LCD,Size: 32-inchStyle: HD,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Got this for my gramms, she's 80, to replace a smaller 42"". She loved this because the closed caption was too small on her original set. Took a while to setup. Got her favorite show setup. All good. 11 pm, calling me in tears and frustration because Alexa did something to the channel, can't get the channel and another channel is playing in Spanish. 45 minutes to talk her thru getting back to hdmi input. 40 days of calls saying she's gonna throw the remote thru the screen because it keeps getting messed up, Even though it's a nice picture. Finally my brother disconnected it and put her old monitor with hdmi back to the xfinity box and she's been happy since. The set is great for features, but not seniors who get confused with electonics. Amazon should consider a Senior Mode, for people who have a set top box with hdmi, that let's you disable all the menus and options other than volume.

"We set it up when we first got it in July and I noticed a very thin turquoise line but thought nothing of it as it seemed to be a good in the plastic screen cover and we put it away 5 min later. We placed it in the den closet in its box until we found a TV stand to match our furniture.
We FINALLY set it up on our new stand and the turquoise line was now accompanied by several lines of different colors. I've ordered 3 TVs from Amazon in a few months and THEY HAVE ALL BEEN CRACKED!!!
.....I really should have checked better.
It didn't initially look to be cracked but I can see how the blue line I first saw was the beginning of an INSIDE hairline crack that became worse.

"The picture quality is stunning. You can literally see the actor's pores and wrinkles. The sound quality is great. The product itself is standard. Looks great, feels great. Nothing about it feels cheap or looks cheap. For $259 this 50"" TV was a steal. I'd totally recommend it. If you're not tech savvy, this might not be for you. I'll talk about it later.

Physically setting up the TV was super quick and straight-forward. As for the actual user experience/software, set up was also straight-forward and simple.

I will say that the FireTv interface is very spammy. There's a few sponsored banners on the home page. A lot of the recommendations are for Prime Video -- which I have -- but a lot of them aren't free with Prime. They're recommending me content that I have to buy /rent -- which makes it feel like I'm being advertised to. Amazon's self-promotion seems to be a common theme in their Fire lineup that just ruins the user experience. If this TV is for an older person, I'd worry that they would accidentally buy these movies and shows.

Luckily for me, I have an XFinity Flex box. If you can get your hands on a Roku, that's even better. (I don't recommend Google Chromecast). Simply plug your streaming device into the HDMI port. Now you have a cleaner interface plus a nice TV picture quality.

If you plan to use a streaming device instead of the FireTv interface, you have to alter your settings. Otherwise, everytime you power on your tv, it will go to the FireTv interface by default. Simply go to Settings > Display & Sounds > Power Controls > Power On >Last Input. Now, it will go to your streaming device on Power On.

All that said, do you really need to use a Roku or another streaming device? No. It's really easy to access HBO MAX, Netflix, or Disney+. It's easy to access your installed apps. If you don't care about aesthetics, you'll be fine. The home page is just busy, spammy, and overwhelming. If you can handle that, no streaming stick required.

Also, for people with Spectrum Tv, FireTv doesn't support a spectrum app. If that's a deal breaker, dont get it.

Also, if want to get the FireTv today, you can get it at Best Buy. Best Buy will price match Amazon products (sold by Amazon; prices set by third party sellers aren't eligible for price match).

Overall, I do recommend this TV. At its price point, it's a steal. If I had a reason to, I'd totally get more. Though next time, I'd probably aim for a bigger size.",B08SVZ775L,Broken but Amazon was great!,Size: 32-inchStyle: HD,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I waited several months before writing a review. We purchased this back in Prime Days and use the TV for several hours a day both for streaming and regular cable (ugh). We also have a DVD player attached for DVD/Blu-ray.

The Pro's- This is 100% out of the box ready to go. We did not wall mount and it sits on a console table. The picture is clear, its immediately tuned in and ready to go once you turn it on. Its also fast to switch between streaming and voice controls almost immediately respond. Arrived liked to my amazon account and ready to go.

The cons- this teeny tiny remote- seriously? The remote is 1/2 the size of an iphone and slippery. I bought a cover and its still a disaster. Needs more HDMI/USB ports.

I've not had any screen issues, any power issues, in 3 months of constant use its doing exactly what a TV should do-",B08SVZ775L,HONEST REVIEW FOR EVERYONE,Size: 24-inchStyle: HD DTS TruSurround,4.0 out of 5 stars
"We hunted for a tv for months, but didn't want a smart tv. Tried two non-Smart ones, for tv only , and were very disappointed in just about every aspect, from picture quality to sound to set up.

Finally decided to try this Fire TV at such a great price point. But figured that it would be disappointing.

What a wonderful surprise! The set up was incredibly easy. Carefully packed, perfect condition, the legs and remote in the top of the styrofoam and tv easy to remove. Unlike the others, this one was light, even in the good packaging. (43"" was the perfect size for our room).

We started by just setting up for tv, no internet, no apps. It was so quick and easy-- Basically, ""no, no, okay."" Manual only; we didn't want Alexa and that was fine. It worked great--looked perfect, sound quality was good , no distortion or buzzing and volume at 50% was already very good I don't know why anyone complained it couldn't go loud enough. The settings are easy to adjust (we get rid of ""action/motion smoothness"" but didn't really need to adjust brightness, color, etc. All really good, right out of the box.

A few days later, we set up the rest. Again, so easy! Wireless network--quick and easy, no problem with password. Tried it without signing into Amazon account---again, like with just using it as a tv--that was a definite option, to use it without linking them.

Then to Amazon sign in which also was quick and easy. Activating the apps, using it for everything we wanted--streaming, Prime videos, Youtube, tv...it all worked so well, far beyond what we expected. When you figure in the price, it's really an amazing deal. The pixel-peeper in the house couldn't even find anything wrong with the picture quality; likewise with the sound. 1080 HD and 720 SD both looked great--noticeably better with higher resolution, but still good either way -- haven't tried 4K (or Ultra 4k) yet, but may upsate afterwards. (Max res supposedly 3840 x 2860, but haven't tried it.) We're really happy
as is. (And all so easy, includng navigation.)

This is a fantastic value. Highly recommended.",B08SVZ775L,"Best value, easy to use and set up,",Size: 39-inchStyle: HD DTS TruSurround,5.0 out of 5 stars

I've ran it through video tests and it's rough. Good thing, it turns on, and it's clear. It's not a Sony so don't expect jaw dropping picture. I do approve this TV.

"I was one of the fortunate ones who got this TV during Amazon Prime Days for $99.99. It was delivered quickly and extremely well packaged, box & tv undamaged. I had a neighbor friend help me get it out of the box and set it up on my bedroom dresser. The TV is HUGE. I have over the air TV (no cable or satellite service) intentionally; I refuse to pay for TV when there is so much to watch for free. I purchased a $20 indoor antenna for the TV as well and hooked it up to the coax input on the back of the TV. Plugged the tv into a surge protected outlet. Placed the batteries in the remote. Turned on the TV using the remote. Setup could not have been easier....the TV did it all itself. Went through several updates, including updating the remote. Found my internet connection and Prime account; everything went beautifully! When the apps popped up on the TV, the picture was outstanding! The sound is no problem for me at all and is fine for my needs without a soundbar. I have it set to about 27. The remote whisked through all of the apps quickly and efficiently. Scanned for over the air channels and found 69, including all of my favorites! My neighbor was so impressed, she turned to me and said, ""how much did you pay for this again?"" I told her and she said I am so jealous...you got one heck of a deal. Look at that picture! I said I am very, very happy! I don't understand the complaints about the blue standby light. It is not very bright at all, non-intrusive and not nearly like a night light; if it bothers you, put tape over it! While I was watching, a pop-up in the right bottom corner came up and told me my Amazon order delivery had just arrived! Wow! The best feature is the Guide, that brings up a screen similar to what I have seen on cable company menus. It shows all of the terrific programming, channels and show times....what a great feature. For me,, this TV is an outstanding value and it exceeded all of my expectations. So glad I got it!",B08SVZ775L,Eh..,Size: 39-inchStyle: HD DTS TruSurround,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Tv works great when you first get it. Easy to set up, difficult to maintain. Remote failed after 2 months and alexa still doesnt work. I paid for convienience and having to repair the remote it came with just to turn the tv on or off (there is no other way) is a huge problem. After troubleshooting a device only 2 months of use and things are failing, my next tv will not be a firetv due to the frustration of constantly having to reset it up. My alexa button doesnt work and there are no clear instructions how to fix it but a factory reset. Very well maintained home, this product seems just designed to fail.

UPDATE** (9/7/2022) A customer outreach rep. Actually called me today about my review. They never asked any personal information and never will, just for you to verify the information they have is correct. This is awesome customer service. The call came from an unknown number from Washington D.C. (200 area code). They tried to help troubleshoot the issue with the remote, agreed it was defective, and immediately sent out a replacement at no charge. My review upgraded due to the fact i felt as Amazon wanted me to be satisfied with my purchase. Review will be updated upon arrival with a completely working remote.

UPDATE** replacement remote arrived in refurbished condition. The remote worked without having to set it up with the exception of the Alexa button again. Although, when i went into the pair settings, this remote connected right away. I was instructed to dispose of the old remote properly from Amazon outreach team. I saved it for a back up.

Customer serveice was beyond expectations and unexpected. Review changed to 5 stars.",B08SVZ775L,Exceeded expectations; wonderful TV!,Size: 32-inchStyle: HD,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought this 55"" TV on Prime Day for $285. For that price, this TV is amazing! If you must pay the full price, I would look elsewhere because there are better TV's for the money. That being said, I am extremely impressed with the picture quality. I am not a TV snob. I have never owned a high-end TV, so I cannot really speak to how it compares to the OLED TV's on the market. The TV that this replaced was a 7-year-old Insignia 1080p 50"". I think, for the general consumer, this TV is more than adequate.

I did not really like the Fire TV OS that came built into this TV. I am already part of the Google Assistant ecosystem. I have Google Assistant speakers and a few Nest Hub's around my house already. As well as a Nest thermostat. I gave the Fire TV OS a fair try, but I really just prefer the Chromecast with Google TV that I was using previously. The one thing I really liked about the Fire TV OS was the live TV guide. It gives all my OTA channels a nice guide just as if it were cable. Plus, it integrates all my streaming channels from lots of different sources. I think that is probably the only thing I will continue to use the Fire OS for.

The speakers on this TV don't sound that great. They are passible, and they sound better than the ones on the TV in my bedroom. I would still highly recommend a sound bar. Fortunately, we already had a Vizio 3.1.2 sound bar. I was able to connect it to the TV with the HDMI eARC port and it works flawlessly.

In conclusion, I would highly recommend this TV to anyone. It has great picture quality and some cool features for the money. Especially if you can purchase it for a discount like I did. Perhaps, if you must pay the full price, shop around and compare with some other options.",B08SVZ775L,Buy this at a extreme discount price only.,Size: 24-inchStyle: HD DTS TruSurround,5.0 out of 5 stars
"So far I have had this TV for about four days, ordered it on Prime Day and received it about the next Friday after and I got this delivered to me during the early morning hours. Usually Amazon Prime delivers during the afternoon around my area so when I got a notification that morning that it was already delivered at six am surprised me as I found it sitting in front of the doorstep. So it was delivered early as it was suppose to be delivered on Saturday but I got it a day earlier. Overall, setting this up was pretty simple, I booted it up and apparently it needed to update right out of the box so I let it update which took about an hour but shortly after that getting all the apps that I use onto the TV was pretty simple as well. The picture quality on the TV is pretty good, I think a soundbar isn't really needed as the sound the TV provides is pretty good as well.

I have a PS5 and so gaming on this TV is pretty cool. It even switches to a gaming type mode of picture quality when you switch to the HDMI that has your PS5 Connected to which is unique because on my PlayStation 5 when I used on that TV it didn't do that at all and I would have to manually do it from the TV but with the Amazon Fire TV I didn't have to configure anything at all as it switched to that kind of pictured mode. My only problem, which it can be the TV itself or the HDMI Cable I have connected to the Cable Box is that at times it would flicker for a second and then stop, but do it again after awhile. When I'm always gaming, this is never an issue though so it could just be the HDMI Cable that could use a replacement. Overall, I am pretty much glad I got this at such an amazing price and maybe I'll use this TV for a good while.",B08SVZ775L,Great TV for the money when you get it on sale,Size: 24-inchStyle: HD DTS TruSurround,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I took advantage of prime day and bought the 55"" version of this TV. I was replacing a 37"" on the wall. The installation was easy, and when first starting up (I associated it with my amazon account when purchasing) it auto-updated a couple of times and kept restarting to do it, but after about 15 minutes was up and ready to go. I played with some of the built in apps and guide and they are pretty cool and work well. I tried airplay from both my iphone and Mac and it works great -- just like an apple TV. I use Tivo, and to get the Tivo remote to work with this TV, I had to use ""Element"" as the brand (so to those reviews where they said the TV is not in the list of other products, use ""Element."" One review complained that the TV always started on the homescreen when turned on, and not the video input they want (HDMI1) You can set it the way you want, but you have to go into settings, picture, power-on options and you can choose home or use last video input used. This way it stays on the cable box etc. The Alexa feature is cool and works, but I really don't use it. One of the reviews complained about not using standard screw sizes for wall mount.. This is not valid.. I ran into a similar issue as I was going from a 37"" to a 55"" and the screw sizes for these size sets are different where one uses M4 vs M6 screws... Any wall mount kit will have the correct size screws included with it, and even if you are replacing an older smaller set like me and have lost the rest of the screws, I went to home depot and they sell them there as M6 in various lengths...

"First time I ordered a TV on-line. The unit arrived, then after I mounted it on the wall, I turned it on and it was a blank screen - Dead on arrival. I spoke with two awesome Amazon reps. The first made it easy to set up the exchange, and the second rep arranged a pre-paid UPS label for the return. Lesson No. 1 - turn on the TV before you mount it on the wall -- duh! Second, the default return shipping label is not pre-paid, but an easy call with the Amazon rep fixed that. Finally, I love the TV and its controls.

"'TV constantly goes back to home screen randomly while using any streaming app. Can be in the middle of a movie and next thing you know, TV goes back to home screen and then you have to open the app and wait for it to load again, but then you have to find where you were interrupted yourself as the TV forgets where it was in that movie. Does it with Netflix, Hulu, Peacock, and Amazon Viedo. Also constantly have a notification that shows the little Android dude and it just says ""Music"" have factory reset the TV and everything and it randomly pops up too. Not worth it at all. Worst Amazon device made to date, although they truly didn't make it, Insignia did. Will NEVER EVER EVER buy INSIGNIA products ever again. Crap products with worse crappy customer service. Should have immediately sent this TV back for a refund!' - My original review August 2022.

Recent software update fixed these issues, my only issue with this version of software is that any commercial interruption while streaming video, will cause the audio and video to be out of sync with one another when the video restarts. The only fix for this is to go back to the Home screen, wait a few minutes and then relaunch the streaming app and restart your video, OR from the home page, click settings, then software, and restart the TV. PRESSING THE POWER BUTTON DOES NOT POWER DOWN THE TV, IT ONLY PUTS IT TO SLEEP (SAME AS YOUR PHONE, TAP IT AGAIN AND IT IS INSTANTLY READY...). So after every single commercial break, the video will be ahead of audio by about 5 seconds, as a lip reader due to hearing impairment, what audio I hear really makes me dizzy trying to focus on the mouth movements to interpret what is being spoken. I have partial loss in one ear, and 90% loss in the other, as a result of military trauma. I rely on reading lips to verify the majority of the sounds I think I hear, for instance, someone might say, ""Nice shoes"" and the sound is muffled by a fan blowing directly toward me, so I think I heard, ""screw you"", ""bless you"", ""who're you"", ""I hate blue"", ""where'sthe crew"", ""...few"", ""...knew"",...the list could go on endlessly. I read their lips and can instantly determine a ""nI-ssss SH-oohs"" by the lip position, and can reply correctly and thank them for the compliment instead of being offended, or my go-to when I can't determine what was said, ""well what do you think?"" to return the ball back in their court, like word tennis.

I have installed only a handful (4 or 5?) apps like Xfinity, Netflix, Hulu, Showtime, Tubi so I can stream. It was a pain to find out how to delete apps. After I cleared out most of my apps, I STILL got the error message. I kept deleting and cleaning out cashes, etc. Finally, I no longer get the error message.

The color is nice and bright . The response with the remote feels just like the firestick also not having that extra is nice. The firestick intergration is really the best feature and convenient.

"UPDATE 03/29/2022: (added stars)
Just wanted to update this review. Amazon Customer Service called me shortly after posting this review (wow! impressive timing) and we talked about setting expectations for the performance of this TV. The way it was explained to me: when the TV is used only about half an hour every day it caches data and has to sync up when finally turned on--this takes a little while to catch up and accurately reflects my experience with the TV.

I will stand by this product and say that it is still definitely worth the price paid--it does the job. I might not choose it as my main source of entertainment, but it more than fits the bill in our exercise room. We discussed an easy workaround to circumvent the performance issue: just unplug it when not in use, and this will improve the performance. Easy enough. Thanks again, and frankly I would certainly be tempted to recommend this product on the exceptional customer service, alone. Thanks, as always--happy to be an Amazon customer!!

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
So we bought this TV for the exercise room to pass time while working out. The TV sets up fine. Everything is ""mostly"" fine. I'm not going to review the Amazon software because, frankly, I don't know where one problem begins and the other ends. Confusing, huh? Here's the thing. The TV itself displays a picture--good enough for an exercise room--the sound is as-expected for being in the unit, etcetera.

The problem is with the user interface. Now I DO NOT WANT TO SPECULATE as my software engineering days are over, but right when the TV ""boots up"" it's pretty fast and responsive. However, given the course of about 3-5 hours of being TURNED OFF and plugged into the wall, when reactivated, the TV will become a very slow user experience. I have some network traffic monitors running against my router (i.e. WireShark / Solar Winds), and I see a large amount of wireless traffic coming from the TV when it's not in use. I'm not sure if this is normal or if it was hacked or what, but I just thought I'd let everyone know.

Disabling some of the targetted advertising cut this down a bit, and I have updated the firmware, but I just can't shake the suspicion that the reason for the slowness is either because the device's storage is filling up (with god-knows-what) or that the device is preoccupied with performing some other task. I have also disabled auto-updates for caching the installed applications (just Amazon Prime and YouTube right now). UX is still very slow after being plugged in for a while.

So we've taken to the habit of unplugging it and re-plugging it just before use. Might just leave it unplugged until we actually need it, but the last thing I want is to power it on, and have to wait while it catches up on all the updates.

Don't get me wrong, in concept, the TV is a great idea: integrated with online services, etc, but I just need more time to dig into the actual traffic being sent from it. Maybe a factory reset will help the speed, but I don't want to delete any proof of unoptimized code or anything. Definitely something I think the manufacturer should look into. ""Internet of Things"" devices are inherently insecure, so we rely upon these manufacturers to secure their devices as well as possible when welcoming them into our homes and networks.

I hope this helps your decision. Maybe best to keep it off the network until they can work out these bugs, but then what do you have? DVD/BLURAY TV? Very limited, and kind of defeats the purpose of getting a ""smart"" TV. Anyways, I'm babbling at this point. I hope this helps, and good luck with your purchase!",B07FPP6TB5,Price is the only factor that prompted me to buy this.,Size: 42 inches,4.0 out of 5 stars

Either way, I’m thrilled. For $100? come on!

"24"" model - unpacking easy but sticky tape around all edges of monitor, cellophane around batteries, sticky tape on remote and legs made it a bit of a trudge. Leg mounting screws were a pain - I don't know if my t.v. was an exception, or the rule - but the holes for the screws were not pre-tapped. Some pressure was required to fully seat all four screws; a good Philips screwdriver is recommended. (Watch the video that's on the Amazon page - you'll notice that the ""unboxing"" guy couldn't get the screws in either and an overlay in text on the video noted to ""Tighten the Screws"". There should be no wobble; wobble isn't for adjusting the t.v. pitch angle, it means the screws are not fully seated. Be careful - you don't want to strip the heads out on those little screws!

Once assembled setup of the t.v. proper was easy but tedious; WiFi connection resulted in a very slow download of apps and operating system - it took perhaps 30 minutes to complete everything. Of course, that will depend upon how many apps you have installed or want to install. My WiFi gives an excellent signal (I'm a retired I.T. tech), but Ethernet beats WiFi everytime so I hooked up an Ethernet cable and things perked up to almost acceptable. No mistake - this is a slow t.v.; I'd recommend Ethernet wherever available. I haven't hooked up a coax antenna yet, so cannot comment on over-the-air broadcast reception.

Sound quality goes right along with the price point of this unit - the price is low and so is the sound quality.

The picture is 720p - so don't expect much, no matter what the paid reviewer on the video reports.

I should note that I ""bought the price, not the t.v.""; I'm using this in my (very) small home office - there's no room on the desk for a second monitor and the Echo Home 8"" device just doesn't cut it for long term viewing of t.v. shows or movies. For my purpose, I'm finding this 24"" t.v. to be acceptable but not terrific. For a small bedroom, travel trailer with 110v available, kitchen, etc. I think this unit is O.K. Even for a kid's room, however, I'd be looking at the upgraded 2022 model for a few bucks more. My ""stars"" score takes into consideration the price point of this t.v. - I wasn't expecting a top-shelf television for this amount of money, and I got what I expected.

"UPDATE: (5 Stars)
.
7 months in and we've had zero problems with this TV. Our fiber internet provider updated the Wi-Fi equipment in our house and this Fire TV is now able to pick up a 160 mbps typical signal strength. The quality of the picture is actually slightly better close-up now, though from several feet away, it's just as good as before.
.
No complaints thus far - a worthy investment. Upping my rating for the trouble-free operation!

ORIGINAL REVIEW: (4 Stars)
.
I wanted to upgrade our 12- and 17-year-old TV's and have been researching all the options. I used rtingsdotcom to compare performance, as well as online reviews, and it wasn't easy. It seemed that unless you were spending big bucks, rtings always had issues.
In the end, I went for the 65"" Vizio M65Q7-JO1 for the main TV. The ratings were pretty good and the value seemed good at $699 with an OEM 3-year warranty from my local membership warehouse. So, far I've been very pleased with it.
This TV also allowed me to have a reference point for the rtings reviews. Knowing what they said about the Vizio compared with what I saw, I was able to use that to gauge other TV's against my needs.
.
These first gen Fire TV's aren't rated at all highly. However, when the 43 inch Fire TV was on sale for $259 with a free Echo Dot, I decided it was worth trying. The smaller TV is used almost exclusively by my wife to watch Food Network and HGTV (!) from a distance of about 13 ft. She doesn't care about smart features and sits almost square on to the TV, slightly down and to the right in a brightly (daylight) illuminated 'sunroom', just off the kitchen.
.
After unpacking the Fire TV, I immediately mounted it on a stand. (PERLESMITH Universal TV Stand - Table Top TV Stand for 37-55 inch LCD LED TVs). The included Fire TV feet would be too wide for the cabinet's shelf. The required mounting screws were already in the VESA mounting points, which was great! No searching around for the right thread and length screws.
.
On powering up the TV, Amazon had it all set up with my Wi-Fi password and Amazon account. Somewhat scary, but understandable, given that we have Echo Dots all around the house. So it automatically updated the firm- and soft-ware and was ready to go! The screen was looking good with no defects. Interestingly, the TV comes with just a short, get-up-and-run pamphlet, with no manual. I searched online and found a pdf, though, being an engineer, I was able to just go through the menus and quickly understand the systems. Other's might struggle. Vizio actually has the manual built into the TV's menu.
.
We use Chromecast with Google TV and stream YoutubeTV on both TV's, as well as my daughter's TV, while she's at college. I didn't even bother to check out the Fire TV apps and immediately installed the Chromecast.
I had trouble with the Chromecast remote. Google doesn't list 'Amazon' or 'Fire TV' as options for the remote codes. I knew from research that the Fire TV is a TCL rebrand and tried that remote code offering. It sort of worked but wasn't good enough. The volume was slow to respond, unless right up close to the TV. The power worked but didn't work to turn on the Chromecast once it had turned itself off. The input selection was also problematic. After much trial and error, I got the Chromecast remote working correctly using the settings shown in the photo.
I also found that I could connect the Fire TV remote to the Chromecast. There's a video on YT on that. The Fire TV remote connects via BT to the Chromecast by long pressing the HOME button to go into pairing mode. You do have to hold the remote right next to the Chromecast itself to get it to connect to the Fire TV remote. It'll come up as 'AR'. Once connected it works perfectly but has to be disconnected to do anything with the TV settings. In the end, I just disconnected it and use the Google remote.
.
I have found that my old TV's had much better reflection handling. Any reflections were very muted. The modern TV's all seem to be more reflective. The Fire TV is a little worse than the Vizio. You can see that in the photo. Fortunately, where my wife sits, the windows are out of view on the TV screen and it's only with a black screen that the reflections are an issue. On the Vizio, I keep the curtains drawn over the window directly behind me.
.
Brightness is as rtings said; not that bright. I found the best picture setting was DYNAMIC, with Cinema mode, Noise Reduction and Dynamic backlight OFF and standard white balance. This gives the brightest picture and the nicest color saturation. The TV works well in the room during the day. The Cinema mode resulted in a noticeable Soap Opera effect, which I don't like.
The display panel washes out very quickly as you view it off-center. At 40 degrees to the screen, the colors are not at all good and faces start to look a little gray. The Vizio is similar, but not as bad. Both are best viewed from directly in front.
.
With 4K content, the picture quality is actually pretty good. I have no complaints. However, really close up, you can see artifacts and a white ghosting around objects. This is especially noticeable on non-4K content, where the close-up image also seems out of focus, with lots of artifacts. However, from a 6ft distance, the image isn't bad.
I watched some old 1980's Bergerac episodes and the picture quality was quite acceptable with my picture settings.
I do see that news text on the screen is not as well defined as on the Vizio. In the photos, you can see the Fire TV letters' edges are rougher and less defined on the Fire TV compared with the albeit a larger and Quantum dot Vizio.
CONCLUSION:
If you are on a tight budget, I think the Amazon Fire TV is a viable option, but I certainly don't recommend you buy it above $280. There are likely better options out there for a few dollars more.",B08SWD2SCK,perfect for my bedroom,Size: 50-Inch,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Amazon Fire TV 43"" 4-Series 4K UHD smart TV.

Why I bought:
Price for 4K HDR 10 capability. Wanted to upgrade from a 1080p yard sale Samsung 32"" in the bedroom. Hard to beat 46% Prime day price reduction!

Pros:
Picture, (for the price) Atmos from Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video
Ultra clear picture even when sitting 3' from screen.
Firmware update fixed bright standby light issue (can now be turned off entirely, which is crucial for a bedroom TV).

Cons:
Hulu app won't do Atmos (yet). Picture is not nearly as good as high end 4K TVs, but still is decent in a darkened room. Fairly flimsy plastic legs are questionable supporting the weight of a VESA shelf and Canton metal center speaker. Like all Amazon gadgets, this kind of locks you into the Alexa/Fire ecosystem. I had to buy a new Yamaha surround receiver to work with the modern copy protection scheme all new 4k TVs have now.

Wish list:
As long as I'm wishing, Dolby Vision, better legs, NextGen ATSC 3.0 tuner. (What features it does have is nearly a miracle for the ultra low price though)

For Amazon:
Great first try into the entry-level 4K market. I'd love to see you top the available features in your follow-up to the 4- Series, while keeping the price low.

Biggest surprise:
How nice everything was at the price point.

Problems?
I installed too many apps at first, causing lag in the operating system. Better since I ""cleaned house."" Interface can glitch, leaving you with a blank screen or back at the home screen.

Value for money:
For 1/5th of of a grand on sale? You betcha!

Other thoughts:
If this is going into a very bright large room, or going to be viewed from extreme angles, you might want to spend more.
For my use in a dimmed, indirect lighting, direct view with a Yamaha Aventage 5.1.2 system for sound, It is the ideal bedroom setup. When viewed from 3 or 4 feet away, you get close to a movie theater experience, even with ""just"" a 43 inch screen.",B08SWD2SCK,"Good, if on a tight budget",Size: 65 in,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Mounting it was extremely easy (although I had my dad do it but he’s got all the carpenter’s tools; a stud finder, power drill and socket wrench set will do that). It’s very light for such a large TV but still pretty sturdy and well designed. It has more HDMI ports than most newer TVs out there, big bonus, as well as optical, USB and Ethernet ports.

As far as interface, super easy. I used Roku previously and this was not a huge leap. It connected to my Amazon account automatically and I had my three other streaming accounts hooked up in minutes. But it walks you though the usual setup the first time you power it on: language, all first time updates, a choice of apps or TV channel searching (can be skipped then added later) and then goes directly to the Home Screen where you can add what you like. Very simple and easy to understand. It doesn’t take forever to load when switching apps; it almost instantly just takes you to where you left off when switching between them. Absolutely love that feature. It does power down when idling on still screens too long but waking and resuming is quick too. The picture and audio settings are a breeze to tweak through the remote. The sound and picture are just right as well; the sound is crisp and balanced and the picture has easy defaults or can be customized. I always turn down the backlight because they always tend to be brighter than i like but it was simple to find. Switching to inputs or new apps is one-button; you don’t have to keep backing out to get to another quickly.

Honestly very impressed. I don’t need a lot of bells and whistles so I like when the things I do need a TV for are simple and seamless. It’s super easy switching between TV and three gaming consoles. Easy to add a HTML splitter and take advantage of more devices on one input if needed.

I’m the first person I know to get a Fire TV so it was a gamble, but it definitely paid off. Very worthwhile to get a mount if you feel confident installing it (you can always pay for installation if not). It’s a great TV to take advantage of newer game consoles. Personally, the Omni series had a bunch of stuff I didn’t need, so if you just need a TV for streaming and gaming, the 4-Series doesn’t disappoint.

On a side note, I saw some reviews about a ‘bright blue standby light’ that no longer exists as of this review. It’s a softer whitish light and not very bright. If a standby light does bother you at night, invest in black electrical tape. I’m not sure why people drop so many stars over minor personal issues. If you do happen to have pet peeves about electronics, it’s always best to research before you buy! And yes, companies do read reviews and see customer suggestions so nitpick away to improve their products. Either way, I have no complaints on what I ended up with.",B08SWD2SCK,Great for the price,Size: 55 in,5.0 out of 5 stars
" We have a handful of TV options that I have upgraded over the last couple years. We have a 65"" LG C2 that is our go to and a 55"" Sony Bravia that is a close second. However, I needed to upgrade our bedroom TV and I needed something smaller and just couldn't bring myself to pay what I had paid for the others (both were well over 5x the asking price here.) When I found this TV for $299, I was skeptical but gave it a go. I have to say, I am pretty impressed overall. Here is what it is like to use:

The software is pretty quick. I attached a video so you can see it. Honestly, it is just as fast as either of our high end TV's and I think the menu is almost certainly better than the LG that is pretty messy. Alexa integration is good as well. All and all, finding something to watch on any streaming service (they are all here and available including AppleTV+) and switching up to regular TV is simple to navigate.

The picture is also pretty impressive to me. Both of our other TV's have much richer colors and deeper blacks. Watching this and than running down to the LG is especially telling. It isn't close. The LG is just brighter, crisper, and darker when it needs to be. That said, Amazon has a good screen here. I am no expert but the colors appear natural. The 4k here is very sharp. While only 60hz, for just regular TV, I don't miss the faster processing of the other TVs much. I did switch the picture from standard to ""movie bright"" which smooths things out a bit. I don't care for my movies and shows to all look like soaps. Just too realistic. Also, I was very concerned about sound here. Cheaper TVs tend to make a save here. Sound isn't rich but this TV gets loud. Plenty loud. No need for an additional sound bar unless you want to listen to music or really enhance your movies.

Overall, I am just really impressed by this TV. Like a lot of other Amazon tech (Fire tablets, ear buds, etc) this TV punches way above its price tag. While our other TV's are dynamite, I do question if they are worth the difference on price after this experience. It is also worth noting that Amazon has recently released a higher end Micro LED Fire TV that starts at $799. This also sounds like a good value but, for me, $300 for this 43"" is just a tremendous value. Buy with confidence. Well done Amazon!",B08SWD2SCK,Liking it so far!,Size: 43-Inches,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Wanted to replace the 43 inch TV in bedroom, as the viewing distance is longer and makes the smaller TV not as enjoyable. With the narrow border, this 55 fits where I felt I might need to stop at a 50 incher.

I immediately hated it and was ready to put back in the box and ship it back, but just took some setup and resetting as mentioned below. Seems like a keeper.

Well packaged (my older ones didn't come with a thick cardboard piece protecting the screen front, this one did, might be standard now).

Pulled old TV off the wall and removed the mount. Had to reuse the VESA mount screws as none are provided in the new TV. With it being much larger than old one, it weighs about half. Power and video connectors are on opposite sides, so had to do a little rewiring.

Once up on the wall and all plugged in, the fun begins. At least 30 minutes of updates once connected to WiFi. However remote is only about 20% functional, even after it got a 3 minute update. Find out how to re-initialize remote to TV, and it works better but TV doesn't think there is a remote. eventually after doing it a few times it sees the remote, and all buttons function.

Picture quality for HDMI input was very bad, and trying to change setup with remote not functioning was a trial. Once remote worked, I could go into setup and select Movie (auto was very bright, lots of compression artifacts) and it looks great.

This TV (I know, it is a FireTV) is very app/streaming centric, but once I found the setting to default to last input, and that is 99% of the time HDMI1, then it behaves like I want, turn on and display my input, not the apps home screen where I have to use the TVs remote to clear it and show input in HDMI1. I mainly use the remote for my satellite service, and rarely use the TV one, but since it is also the streaming apps, I will use it, and it adds yet another Alexa mic to do things from, TV related or not.

TV can be slow sometimes to turn on (it turns on reasonably, but doesn't show what is on the input for a while), again thought the remote was misbehaving again, it was just taking time to show anything.

Sound is better than old TV, none of them are real great, I do have a sound bar but I can use this TV with out for watching news and normal shows (not action movies or things with lots of audio like music).

I purchased this TV based on the price and reviews as well as being part of the Amazon Fire family. I have had it set up for almost a week now and am enjoying it quite a bit.

Responsiveness:

My wife and I have used Amazon Fire TV devices for years now and it's nice not needing a stick or a cube to access the Fire interface. The menus are quick to load and responsive with content loading quickly and easily. (Note: this TV is used via ethernet connection in conjunction with 300Mbps download cable Internet).

Packaging:

Packaging was secure and kept the TV from damage in shipping. There was a small dent and tear in the box upon arrival but the 1 inch thick corrugated cardboard shield protecting the screen kept the TV from receiving any damage. The TV arrived within the 2 day Prime delivery time. The box was the store shelf box and was not a nondescript plain shipping box so anyone seeing the delivered TV would know what it was. Fortunately, my wife was at home to recieve the delivery so she asked the guy to place it in our garage for her.

Setup:

Setup was as easy as advertised. Connecting power and a few cables (ethernet, HDMI, HDMI eARC, etc.) and it was up and running. An update was downloaded and installed immediately and after a rapid automatic restart, the Amazon account setup opened on screen. Since we have an account, I just paired it to my account and selected to import all my account settings. Done and running.

I mounted the TV to a raised stand bracket we used for our previous TV and was pleased all my existing harware worked for the new TV. The mounting holes on the back of the TV fit with the universal mounting bracket I already had and the harware worked flawlessly. Bonus!

Sound:

I paired this TV with an Amazon suggested soundbar (Sony HTS100F 2.0ch) and was delighted with how easily they paired up and that the Amazon Fire remote controlled the soundbar immediately without any code cycling or other shenanigans. In fact, I didn't even bother to put the batteries in the Sound soundbar remote.

Picture:

Going from a 10 year old LCD 1080p TV to a 4K TV was a vast improvment in picture. I pulled up Disney+ and started Book of Boba Fett to see how it displayed the dark scenes in that first episode. After messing with the brightness and backlight settings a bit I had a picture I was extremely happy with. I checked the show info and saw I was watching in 2160p and marveled at the difference between my previous 1080p experience. With a 2TB data cap though, we'll have to watch our 4K streaming consumption.

Connections:

This TV has 3 dedicated HDMI ports and an HDMI eARC port. It has ethernet, USB, optical audio, etc.) I also use this TV with a home theater PC connected via HDMI and was delighted with the resolution upgrade while using the TV as a PC monitor.

A few snags:

1. On day 2 I was unable to get the TV to respond to the remote to turn on. I used the physical power button in the bottom middle of the TV to start it manually and the remote functioned fine after that. Since that, the remote has functioned flawlessly to turn on the TV. I have no idea what caused the initial issue.

2. I left the TV set to HDMI 1 (HTPC) when I shut it one night and the next day when I powered on the TV, the screen was flickering white noise and wouldn't bring up my Windows home screen. I used the home button on the remote to get back to Amazon's Fire interface and then switch back to HDMI 1 (HTPC) and had no issue with the picture. I have not been able to repeat this issue so am unsure what may have casued it.

Thoughts:

Despite a few odd snags, I have been extremely pleased with my experience with this TV so far. I belive the manufacturer is TCL and is considered a lower tier manufacturer but I haven't noticed any inferior features or quality in picture or sound. A wonderful experience on the whole. The two snags were the only thing keeping this from a 5 star review. I would say this is more like a 4 3/4 star review.",B08SWD2SCK,"Took some tweaking, remote is not very responsive",Size: 50-Inch,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm UPDATING my review, as Amazon's amazing outreach support team has saved the day. Apparently there IS a fix for the wavy picture, and the TV works perfectly fine now. The picture is great, functionality is great, sound is great, and it even looks great playing Zelda:BOTW on Switch. Now that the wavy picture is gone, this is an excellent TV for a great price. THANK YOU Amazon!

PREVIOUS REVIEW:
I ordered the first TV, then noticed that the picture would be wavy - most noticeably during dark scenes. It happened frequently, and became pretty annoying. Worked with the ""Fire TV department"" of Amazon's customer service, which was a nightmare - unlike ALL of my previous dealings with Amazon's standard customer service - and they sent another TV. This one did the exact same thing. At this point, I decided that it was more hassle to replace it (and they wanted me to return it, then pay almost $100 more to re-purchase the exact same TV!!), and I've decided to keep it as a bedroom TV. The rest of the functionality is fine as a secondary TV, so if you want to pretend that you're underwater or 'under the influence', then it's a good enough TV if you can get it at a discount (Prime Day, for example). Otherwise, save yourself the trouble and keep looking and get something that won't drive you mad.",B08SWD2SCK,Purchased to replace 10 year old Sony LCD,Size: 65 in,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Got this for my gramms, she's 80, to replace a smaller 42"". She loved this because the closed caption was too small on her original set. Took a while to setup. Got her favorite show setup. All good. 11 pm, calling me in tears and frustration because Alexa did something to the channel, can't get the channel and another channel is playing in Spanish. 45 minutes to talk her thru getting back to hdmi input. 40 days of calls saying she's gonna throw the remote thru the screen because it keeps getting messed up, Even though it's a nice picture. Finally my brother disconnected it and put her old monitor with hdmi back to the xfinity box and she's been happy since. The set is great for features, but not seniors who get confused with electonics. Amazon should consider a Senior Mode, for people who have a set top box with hdmi, that let's you disable all the menus and options other than volume. The tv is still sitting in her hallway since i can't return it.",B08SWD2SCK,No more waves!,Size: 50-Inch,5.0 out of 5 stars

"We set it up when we first got it in July and I noticed a very thin turquoise line but thought nothing of it as it seemed to be a good in the plastic screen cover and we put it away 5 min later. We placed it in the den closet in its box until we found a TV stand to match our furniture.
We FINALLY set it up on our new stand and the turquoise line was now accompanied by several lines of different colors. I've ordered 3 TVs from Amazon in a few months and THEY HAVE ALL BEEN CRACKED!!!
.....I really should have checked better.
It didn't initially look to be cracked but I can see how the blue line I first saw was the beginning of an INSIDE hairline crack that became worse.
Since we bought it on July and it's now Oct, I am out of the return period but since it was the inner screen that was defective the manufacture warranty covered it!

"The picture quality is stunning. You can literally see the actor's pores and wrinkles. The sound quality is great. The product itself is standard. Looks great, feels great. Nothing about it feels cheap or looks cheap. For $259 this 50"" TV was a steal. I'd totally recommend it. If you're not tech savvy, this might not be for you. I'll talk about it later.

Physically setting up the TV was super quick and straight-forward. As for the actual user experience/software, set up was also straight-forward and simple.

I will say that the FireTv interface is very spammy. There's a few sponsored banners on the home page. A lot of the recommendations are for Prime Video -- which I have -- but a lot of them aren't free with Prime. They're recommending me content that I have to buy /rent -- which makes it feel like I'm being advertised to. Amazon's self-promotion seems to be a common theme in their Fire lineup that just ruins the user experience. If this TV is for an older person, I'd worry that they would accidentally buy these movies and shows.

Luckily for me, I have an XFinity Flex box. If you can get your hands on a Roku, that's even better. (I don't recommend Google Chromecast). Simply plug your streaming device into the HDMI port. Now you have a cleaner interface plus a nice TV picture quality.

If you plan to use a streaming device instead of the FireTv interface, you have to alter your settings. Otherwise, everytime you power on your tv, it will go to the FireTv interface by default. Simply go to Settings > Display & Sounds > Power Controls > Power On >Last Input. Now, it will go to your streaming device on Power On.

All that said, do you really need to use a Roku or another streaming device? No. It's really easy to access HBO MAX, Netflix, or Disney+. It's easy to access your installed apps. If you don't care about aesthetics, you'll be fine. The home page is just busy, spammy, and overwhelming. If you can handle that, no streaming stick required.

Also, for people with Spectrum Tv, FireTv doesn't support a spectrum app. If that's a deal breaker, dont get it.

Also, if want to get the FireTv today, you can get it at Best Buy. Best Buy will price match Amazon products (sold by Amazon; prices set by third party sellers aren't eligible for price match).

Overall, I do recommend this TV. At its price point, it's a steal. If I had a reason to, I'd totally get more. Though next time, I'd probably aim for a bigger size.",B08SWD2SCK,Broken but Amazon was great!,Size: 43-Inches,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I waited several months before writing a review. We purchased this back in Prime Days and use the TV for several hours a day both for streaming and regular cable (ugh). We also have a DVD player attached for DVD/Blu-ray.

The Pro's- This is 100% out of the box ready to go. We did not wall mount and it sits on a console table. The picture is clear, its immediately tuned in and ready to go once you turn it on. Its also fast to switch between streaming and voice controls almost immediately respond. Arrived liked to my amazon account and ready to go.

The cons- this teeny tiny remote- seriously? The remote is 1/2 the size of an iphone and slippery. I bought a cover and its still a disaster. Needs more HDMI/USB ports.

I've not had any screen issues, any power issues, in 3 months of constant use its doing exactly what a TV should do-",B08SWD2SCK,HONEST REVIEW FOR EVERYONE,Size: 43-Inches,4.0 out of 5 stars
"We hunted for a tv for months, but didn't want a smart tv. Tried two non-Smart ones, for tv only , and were very disappointed in just about every aspect, from picture quality to sound to set up.

Finally decided to try this Fire TV at such a great price point. But figured that it would be disappointing.

What a wonderful surprise! The set up was incredibly easy. Carefully packed, perfect condition, the legs and remote in the top of the styrofoam and tv easy to remove. Unlike the others, this one was light, even in the good packaging. (43"" was the perfect size for our room).

We started by just setting up for tv, no internet, no apps. It was so quick and easy-- Basically, ""no, no, okay."" Manual only; we didn't want Alexa and that was fine. It worked great--looked perfect, sound quality was good , no distortion or buzzing and volume at 50% was already very good I don't know why anyone complained it couldn't go loud enough. The settings are easy to adjust (we get rid of ""action/motion smoothness"" but didn't really need to adjust brightness, color, etc. All really good, right out of the box.

A few days later, we set up the rest. Again, so easy! Wireless network--quick and easy, no problem with password. Tried it without signing into Amazon account---again, like with just using it as a tv--that was a definite option, to use it without linking them.

Then to Amazon sign in which also was quick and easy. Activating the apps, using it for everything we wanted--streaming, Prime videos, Youtube, tv...it all worked so well, far beyond what we expected. When you figure in the price, it's really an amazing deal. The pixel-peeper in the house couldn't even find anything wrong with the picture quality; likewise with the sound. 1080 HD and 720 SD both looked great--noticeably better with higher resolution, but still good either way -- haven't tried 4K (or Ultra 4k) yet, but may upsate afterwards. (Max res supposedly 3840 x 2860, but haven't tried it.) We're really happy
as is. (And all so easy, includng navigation.)

This is a fantastic value. Highly recommended.",B08SWD2SCK,"Best value, easy to use and set up,",Size: 50-Inch,5.0 out of 5 stars

"I was one of the fortunate ones who got this TV during Amazon Prime Days for $99.99. It was delivered quickly and extremely well packaged, box & tv undamaged. I had a neighbor friend help me get it out of the box and set it up on my bedroom dresser. The TV is HUGE. I have over the air TV (no cable or satellite service) intentionally; I refuse to pay for TV when there is so much to watch for free. I purchased a $20 indoor antenna for the TV as well and hooked it up to the coax input on the back of the TV. Plugged the tv into a surge protected outlet. Placed the batteries in the remote. Turned on the TV using the remote. Setup could not have been easier....the TV did it all itself. Went through several updates, including updating the remote. Found my internet connection and Prime account; everything went beautifully! When the apps popped up on the TV, the picture was outstanding! The sound is no problem for me at all and is fine for my needs without a soundbar. I have it set to about 27. The remote whisked through all of the apps quickly and efficiently. Scanned for over the air channels and found 69, including all of my favorites! My neighbor was so impressed, she turned to me and said, ""how much did you pay for this again?"" I told her and she said I am so jealous...you got one heck of a deal. Look at that picture! I said I am very, very happy! I don't understand the complaints about the blue standby light. It is not very bright at all, non-intrusive and not nearly like a night light; if it bothers you, put tape over it! While I was watching, a pop-up in the right bottom corner came up and told me my Amazon order delivery had just arrived! Wow! The best feature is the Guide, that brings up a screen similar to what I have seen on cable company menus. It shows all of the terrific programming, channels and show times....what a great feature. For me,, this TV is an outstanding value and it exceeded all of my expectations. So glad I got it!",B08SWD2SCK,Eh..,Size: 55 in,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Tv works great when you first get it. Easy to set up, difficult to maintain. Remote failed after 2 months and alexa still doesnt work. I paid for convienience and having to repair the remote it came with just to turn the tv on or off (there is no other way) is a huge problem. After troubleshooting a device only 2 months of use and things are failing, my next tv will not be a firetv due to the frustration of constantly having to reset it up. My alexa button doesnt work and there are no clear instructions how to fix it but a factory reset. Very well maintained home, this product seems just designed to fail.

UPDATE** (9/7/2022) A customer outreach rep. Actually called me today about my review. They never asked any personal information and never will, just for you to verify the information they have is correct. This is awesome customer service. The call came from an unknown number from Washington D.C. (200 area code). They tried to help troubleshoot the issue with the remote, agreed it was defective, and immediately sent out a replacement at no charge. My review upgraded due to the fact i felt as Amazon wanted me to be satisfied with my purchase. Review will be updated upon arrival with a completely working remote.

UPDATE** replacement remote arrived in refurbished condition. The remote worked without having to set it up with the exception of the Alexa button again. Although, when i went into the pair settings, this remote connected right away. I was instructed to dispose of the old remote properly from Amazon outreach team. I saved it for a back up.

"I bought this 55"" TV on Prime Day for $285. For that price, this TV is amazing! If you must pay the full price, I would look elsewhere because there are better TV's for the money. That being said, I am extremely impressed with the picture quality. I am not a TV snob. I have never owned a high-end TV, so I cannot really speak to how it compares to the OLED TV's on the market. The TV that this replaced was a 7-year-old Insignia 1080p 50"". I think, for the general consumer, this TV is more than adequate.

I did not really like the Fire TV OS that came built into this TV. I am already part of the Google Assistant ecosystem. I have Google Assistant speakers and a few Nest Hub's around my house already. As well as a Nest thermostat. I gave the Fire TV OS a fair try, but I really just prefer the Chromecast with Google TV that I was using previously. The one thing I really liked about the Fire TV OS was the live TV guide. It gives all my OTA channels a nice guide just as if it were cable. Plus, it integrates all my streaming channels from lots of different sources. I think that is probably the only thing I will continue to use the Fire OS for.

The speakers on this TV don't sound that great. They are passible, and they sound better than the ones on the TV in my bedroom. I would still highly recommend a sound bar. Fortunately, we already had a Vizio 3.1.2 sound bar. I was able to connect it to the TV with the HDMI eARC port and it works flawlessly.

In conclusion, I would highly recommend this TV to anyone. It has great picture quality and some cool features for the money. Especially if you can purchase it for a discount like I did. Perhaps, if you must pay the full price, shop around and compare with some other options.",B08SWD2SCK,Buy this at a extreme discount price only.,Size: 55 in,5.0 out of 5 stars
"So far I have had this TV for about four days, ordered it on Prime Day and received it about the next Friday after and I got this delivered to me during the early morning hours. Usually Amazon Prime delivers during the afternoon around my area so when I got a notification that morning that it was already delivered at six am surprised me as I found it sitting in front of the doorstep. So it was delivered early as it was suppose to be delivered on Saturday but I got it a day earlier. Overall, setting this up was pretty simple, I booted it up and apparently it needed to update right out of the box so I let it update which took about an hour but shortly after that getting all the apps that I use onto the TV was pretty simple as well. The picture quality on the TV is pretty good, I think a soundbar isn't really needed as the sound the TV provides is pretty good as well.

I have a PS5 and so gaming on this TV is pretty cool. It even switches to a gaming type mode of picture quality when you switch to the HDMI that has your PS5 Connected to which is unique because on my PlayStation 5 when I used on that TV it didn't do that at all and I would have to manually do it from the TV but with the Amazon Fire TV I didn't have to configure anything at all as it switched to that kind of pictured mode. My only problem, which it can be the TV itself or the HDMI Cable I have connected to the Cable Box is that at times it would flicker for a second and then stop, but do it again after awhile. When I'm always gaming, this is never an issue though so it could just be the HDMI Cable that could use a replacement. Overall, I am pretty much glad I got this at such an amazing price and maybe I'll use this TV for a good while.",B08SWD2SCK,Great TV for the money when you get it on sale,Size: 50-Inch,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I took advantage of prime day and bought the 55"" version of this TV. I was replacing a 37"" on the wall. The installation was easy, and when first starting up (I associated it with my amazon account when purchasing) it auto-updated a couple of times and kept restarting to do it, but after about 15 minutes was up and ready to go. I played with some of the built in apps and guide and they are pretty cool and work well. I tried airplay from both my iphone and Mac and it works great -- just like an apple TV. I use Tivo, and to get the Tivo remote to work with this TV, I had to use ""Element"" as the brand (so to those reviews where they said the TV is not in the list of other products, use ""Element."" One review complained that the TV always started on the homescreen when turned on, and not the video input they want (HDMI1) You can set it the way you want, but you have to go into settings, picture, power-on options and you can choose home or use last video input used. This way it stays on the cable box etc. The Alexa feature is cool and works, but I really don't use it. One of the reviews complained about not using standard screw sizes for wall mount.. This is not valid.. I ran into a similar issue as I was going from a 37"" to a 55"" and the screw sizes for these size sets are different where one uses M4 vs M6 screws... Any wall mount kit will have the correct size screws included with it, and even if you are replacing an older smaller set like me and have lost the rest of the screws, I went to home depot and they sell them there as M6 in various lengths...

The first made it easy to set up the exchange, and the second rep arranged a pre-paid UPS label for the return. Lesson No. 1 - turn on the TV before you mount it on the wall -- duh! Second, the default return shipping label is not pre-paid, but an easy call with the Amazon rep fixed that. Finally, I love the TV and its controls.

"I consider myself trch savvy, but this one took a minute to set up. Be weary of setting up a child's profile on the tv, I am tempted to factory reset the device and start over due to all of the headaches of having a child profile associated with it. I even removed the child profile and still am having issues. Alexa won't start programs on the tv via voice command from my echo dot because it can not control child profiles, but my child profile has been removed... so I'm a little frustrated with this at the moment.

As the others have said the top streaming services that appear on the remote work much better on the TV then the others downloaded. Amazon prime and Netflix run without hiccup and have great screen resolution. I feel like resolution is a little lower and responsiveness is slower for paramount and disney.

I love the alexa based integration. I use it to control my connected hue bulbs and other smart switches.

I love the landing page where you can see recommendations and continue watching options from all associated platforms on a single home or landing page. This is an amazing feature that makes me look past some of the other integration issues I have been having.

I put passive shields on to redirect and I’ve never had to turn up beyond 14. The picture quality is much better than I thought it would be. Great colors and very bright. So far I haven’t had any problems with Wi-Fi smart features (don’t use Alexa) I only stream on this tv and it’s working out just fine, the remote works great and I’m happy. I ordered and picked up at Best Buy same day. Totally easy and convenient.
I did put on a swivel stand because I hate those feet and want to be able to turn tv as needed.
Can’t beat the price, I did purchase on a special deal.
Recommend for smaller space but realize it’s not a super HD picture quality so it’s a matter of what you are looking for.",B08X7JSCHQ,My Cat Likes It,Size: 24 inStyle: 1080pConfiguration: Bezel,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I found 1) pretty easy to attach the stand. It was a tad bit of a try to get the screws in since they are much shorter than the drop it is into the hole, so it took a couple of tries. 2) Easy setup.

The first is a one-time thing and I found it manageable. The Second is key. A third is that it is light yet sturdy (cat already tried to investigate it and it is still standing) The picture quality is clear, sound (where it is located) I good. It does lag every so often yet all in all it is a good product",B08X7JSCHQ,I’m impressed,Size: 32 inStyle: 1080pConfiguration: Bezel,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The stand/feet would not stay on. The enclosed screws were too short and there was damage to the place where the feet were supposed to attach. After many hours of trying to get the feet to stay attached, I had to find some longer screws and substitute those and I also super-glued them on so that they would not come out. Other than that, the TV works as advertised and was otherwise very easy to set up. I suggest that the manufacturer rethink the design of the stand so that the screws do not have to be dropped so far down into such a deep well inside the feet in order to attach them.",B08X7JSCHQ,Perfect For A Bedroom,Size: 24 inStyle: 1080pConfiguration: Bezel,5.0 out of 5 stars

"I love the TV, but the remote is pretty wimpy. It’s the same remote (or similar to) the remote we use in the bedroom for the Roku connected to a Panasonic Plasma screen that’s over fifteen years old. Television is perfect. The remote, not so much. It’ll pass, but we’ll probably add a universal remote to replace it and add it to our arsenal. That cost will be added to the overall cost of this television and it’s less than par remote. We’ll remember this and will know better when we begin looking for televisions to replace the older one in the bedroom. We’re also disappointed that there’s no other way to introduce audio to our home theatre system without purchasing a third party piece of equipment that will change the digital audio output to RCA inputs. I know it seems like older technology, but the television doesn’t even provide any Bluetooth capabilities to use a third party device we already have. We will absolutely do more research when it’s time to upgrade the plasma screen in the bedroom. We'll have a similar issue there.

Update: We chose to purchase a Roku Voice Remote that works great with our new television. We’d prefer using a keypad, but this works. We’ll probably still go a different route when we replace the plasma screen in the bedroom.

Update: We woke up one morning and the televise wouldn’t display a picture. We contacted the vendor and they said someone local would come to my house to see what the problem was. Nine days later, a local television repair company showed up. He and his “helper” proceeded to take the circuit board off my television then scratch up the front screen stating the board was bad and the television was no longer operable. I asked what I was supposed to do with the non-working television and he said I’d have to dispose of it myself. I asked about the $469 I had paid for the television six months ago and he said that Hisense would be reaching out to me within 24 hours. Three days later, Hisense called and said they’d be sending me a refund and I should expect a check in the mail in 10-14 days. I asked about them just sending me a replacement set and they told me that this would not be an option. I even offered to upgrade from a 55” screen to a 65” screen. Nope. Wasn’t going to happen. Four weeks later, the check arrived.

Would I ever purchase another Hisense television? Probably not. I think I’m going to take my money and purchase TCL 65” screen from a local big box store. Hisense and their “customer service” sucks.",B08PDTM9ZD,TV,Style: 55-inch,4.0 out of 5 stars

"To begin with, this review is for the Vizio D24f-J09. Amazon reviews can be very helpful...to a point. Unfortunately, they often include models other than the one you're viewing, so you have to be careful when relying on them. In this instance, reviews go as far back as 2018, which means they are for TV's other than this one.
I tried two other 24"" TV's (LG and Insignia) and the pictures were very mediocre (although some reviewers thought they were fine). I had a Samsung 24"" before with a beautiful picture, so I had something to compare them to. The picture on this TV is not as good, but it is pretty good, once adjusted properly (I'll speak to that in a moment). It is the most recent 24"" TV from Vizio (as of March 2022). There is one other 24"" model in their recent lineup, the D24f4-j01 which has a bezel-less design.
Of interest to almost everyone getting a 24"" TV is the sound. Out of the box, the sound is OK, but not as loud as many would prefer. However, there is a way to correct this, which I'll get to shortly.
As to reliability, I've had this since November 2021, so it's too soon to tell. So far, so good, although Vizio has a bad track record in that regard.
It comes with lots of apps built in, probably all that most people would want. I don't see a way to add more. I can't tell you how well they work on the TV itself, as I use Amazon's Fire TV stick. With that, you can add tons of apps. That works very well.
There are two HDMI inputs on the back. It should be noted that this is not the traditional ultra-thin TV. It is 2 1/4"" thick, which allow for better (not great) speakers.
OK, the settings you will need to get the best picture. This is the results of weeks of fine-tuning that seemed the best to me. You may need to make minor adjustments for your eye, but I suggest you try these for a few days before making any changes to allow yourself to get used to them.
Go to settings (the black and white ""sun"" button below the Pluto button on the upper left)/picture. These settings are in the order that they appear.

"Received this 32” TV on June 27, 2022.

I connected it to my fiber optic cable which is 350 Mb/s. Accepted the connection. Tried to do the update. FAILED. Checked the connection. TV said it was connected but no network. Gave an error code and said FAILED.

Checked my modem which said that it was connected. Still could not do the update.
Re-booted the TV. Came back on and showed that it was downloading 5 files. Downloaded each file and then installed them. Checked the updates, not there.

Decided to get the app from Google Play. Paired the tablet to the TV. Chose for it to forget the wifi connection. Entered password again. Successful download!

Double checked the TV connection. SUCCESS. No more error messages saying NO NETWORK CONNECTION.

Had a TCL ROKU TV for only 6 years. Developed screen problems where the top of the screen had a dark band across it. Did not want another ROKU TV. Also did not want a FireTV.

Wanted a TV that I could just use a ROKU ULTRA and watch what I wanted.

This TV is in my bedroom. I don’t need 4K in my bedroom.

It has become harder to find 32” TVs that are not 4K.

I don’t know anything about monitors. The apps on this TV are totally unneeded for me.
Thank goodness this TV is cheap and does what I want!

The picture is great!

"As you can see from the picture, the FIRST TV I was sent was not an acceptable product. And honestly, I believe they sent this shattered screen one on purpose because I called & complained about a delivery hold up, so I believe they just grabbed a broken one & threw it on the truck because I suddenly & very quickly got it like the next day, strangely enough. Even more strange was that the two capable gentlemen who delivered this one had it strapped securely to the inside rear of the truck with absolutely nothing around it (in an empty 10ft radius) that could've damaged it so badly & they were not reckless or dropsy, so I'm still not sure how a TV shipped & handled that securely got shattered across the entire front of the screen while being handled by such careful pros. Thankfully the replacement was much better and I received a free, ""DELUXE DELIVERY & UNBOX"" which was a very misleading thing because when they got here w/ the TV, the young gentleman in charge continually explained how they could do nothing but take it out of the box, plug it in and ensure operation, which amounted to making sure it turned on, and then take the box and leave. That's it, that's all! They literally wouldn't even help me lift it onto the table where it was to sit. I still don't know what was ""DELUXE"" about this Deluxe Delivery & Unbox. Oh, & the same guy complaining about all they couldn't do for me instead of focusing on what he could do? He also had to (quite annoyingly) repeatedly tell me that they weren't even ""supposed to deliver to you because of the construction"" going on in what used to be our apt bldg's parking lot. Yet Amazon delivers here practically everyday. But for some strange reason he was insistent that the construction out front was a definite No No for Amazon deliveries (or maybe he meant just for TV deliveries). I'm stil not sure. Either way, still makes no sense.
So now to the TV. I ordered this 65"" Samsung Crystal Tizen for TWO MAIN REASONS.
1) It had a voice remote & 3 voice assistants to choose from, but since I like Google & they were pushing this as a Google TV w/ Google Assistant, that was a big selling point for me. Actually the biggest selling point. I knew I could very easily connect my already established Google Assistant like I had done on a 4K Chromecast I bought from Walmart in 2020. But sadly, THAT NEVER HAPPENED! After speaking extensively to Samsung TV support, Google & Google Assistant support, Amazon support, & even some support chat bots & emails & community support forums & you name it, I tried it. The best advice I got to simply move forward from this nightmare fiasco was to go ahead & just use one of the other two remaining voice assistants that were still available on the TV, Samsung's Bixby, or Amazon's Alexa. Both of which I dislike. What I had seen of Samsung's Bixby from interaction with it on my Samsung Galaxy phones and tablets was that it was fully advertisement saturated, and I dislike that immensely. Whereas Amazon's Alexa is just one big speaking algorithm designed primarily for nothing more than selling more Amazon merchandise. I don't need that on my TV remote & I'm also not buying another device to connect to it just to get it to work properly with the TV. Because of course if you select Alexa as your voice assistant they immediately try to upsell you into an Echo or some other unnecessary thing you don't need to operate a voice assistant on your TV remote. I've been using Roku voice remotes for 3 or 4 yrs now & they work just fine w/ their system as is. No extra device purchase necessary. My Google Chromecast works amazingly well with its Google Assistant voice remote. Both of those items were less than $100 each. Buuuut, a brand new 65"" 4K Samsung Crystal Tizen has the WORST voice assistant remote I've ever encountered. And it WILL NOT HOOK UP TO GOOGLE ASSISTANT. So, on to the . . . .
2nd REASON I PURCHASED THIS TV?
Because it had 4K UPSCALING!!! What a huge feature in a TV this inexpensive! I'd purchased a Sony Blu-ray player w/ 4K upscaling and it was amazing. I fell in love with how old DVD movies were brought up to nearly 4K quality with doing nothing more than putting the movie in the carriage and pushing play. So when I saw that this Samsung Crystal Tizen had 4K upscaling in all picture viewing formats, BOOM, I was all in. That 4K upscaling & the 4K picture clarity in it's Dynamic viewing mode have been the ONLY redeeming qualities in this entire fiasco of a purchase.
Talk about a bunch of ridiculous false advertising, pitiful customer support & delivery inadequacies, & more difficulty & flawed merchandise than one person should have to endure in an entire year? But of course these are all avoidable issues that I somehow created on my own when I clicked, ""Add to cart"" & made a purchase, fully believing & trusting that i was going to receive what i had read & saw with my own eyes, in the time i was told I'd receive it.
(Speaking of, did I mention the reason I called and complained about the delayed shipping to begin with was that my item, the broken TV in the picture, had been sitting in a little suburb about 20 minutes outside of town for going on 2 days and had not moved according to the tracking details? Which is why i believe when I called to inquire about it, that is what they sent me. Nearly 2 days in one spot 20 mins away from me? What would you do?)
Oh, & apparently I'll never have Google Assistant on this TV. It just won't connect. Keeps telling me to login & connect but won't let me. I've been FORCED to use Samsung's Bixby as the voice assistant for the TV & remote. UGGGHHHHH!!!
IN CLOSING - ITS A GOOD TV FOR THIS PRICE, BUT IF THEY RAISE THE PRICE? LOOK ELSEWHERE. AND REMEMBER, THE ONE FEATURE YOU'RE PERSONALLY AFTER? THE ONE FEATURE THAT MAY BE THE SELLING POINT THAT SOLD YOU ON THIS TV? IT'S HIGHLY POSSIBLE IT MAY NOT WORK OR WORK CORRECTLY. It's also a very high possibility that if you run into shipping and delivery issues, you can end up with a broken TV and have to do a long & painstaking, time consuming, long time waiting for your money back, refund and return.

"I am finding many,many features to adjust and turn on or off to control every day. The speakers are OK for normal sound and an EQ can be enabled. I bought 2 Bluetooth 5.0 headsets from SoundCore and noticed some inputs had that Bluetooth sound sync mismatch showing lips moving too late or early. I read about AptX LL (low latency) enabled TV and Headsets required for Video use with syncing sound with video. The sync off because I FF or RW streaming bit too much ...with non AptX phones I feared I had to buy 2 new headphones but it went away by it self. HDMI input #2 has the advanced type HDMI plug. I used that for my Xfinity Arris 4K cable box with a DVR HDrive or SSD. You need the small new XG1v4 DVR/cable box to output 4K to TV from them or they can send the tiny non-DVR one to go with normal HD box that does cloud only 4K. The only problem is the XG1v4 4K DVR cannot be controlled by the small Universal Remote provided currently. I tried the 20 attempts many times and even chose Arris as the manufacturer and the model #AX014ANM and the XG1v4 name and nothing works yet like on the other Xfinity boxes I had for a while. It says make sure your cable box is set for IR infrared to work but the cable box is fixed RF radio frequency only not dual type. Too bad the Remote is not dual output. Have to have 2 remotes.

"Delivery was fine, I guess. It was a “drop and run” situation - last time we ordered a TV from Amazon delivery was via a private company that actually unpacked it and plugged it in. This was delivered by Amazon and it was left on our porch with no knock or doorbell ring.

This TV Arrived with damage to the box and the back of the TV crushed. Miraculously the TV worked but we still returned because we were concerned that the the back would give out when mounted.

They picked up 5 days after delivery and it was picked up 6 days ago - not sure how long it would take to get back to Amazon to credit my card. We are still waiting as it says return started but there is no confirmation of pickup or any easy way to track it online since it’s a private 3rd party company which is concerning. That experience will determine if we order a replacement via Amazon or Costco.

The picture was good, set up easy through Samsung app that we had to download. The remote is weird/wonky and the interface is kind of clunky. I don’t love that. Though to use remote to get back to channel guide/source. But if you are familiar with newer Samsung products it will probably come naturally to you.

"Bought this TV to replace a 6 year old Samsung. Very happy with it.
As others have said, if you want the best TV to hook up your $1500 gaming pc to or play the best of the best Xbox series X games on at the highest settings, you can find better tvs (for a lot more money)

But if you want a very good TV to watch sports, streaming, movies and regular shows, this is great.

I'm a bit puzzled as to why others said the TV sound is bad. We have another 4-5 year old TCL tv, and this tv sounds much better. We even have a $200 sound bar hooked up to the old tv....I tried hooking that soundbar up to this TV and it was only a slight improvement over the speakers in the TV.
Of course, buy yourself an expensive soundbar or one with a seperate subwoofer and it will sound better, but this TV for sure sounds better than similar TVs just a couple years old.

The Biggest thing I was concerned about was the Roku smart TV features. We have a Cable app built in (as we did on our old Samsung TV) and it responded VERY slowly on the Samsung. Happy to say it is much quicker on the TV.

In the menu it does have various settings so you can get the picture quality to just how you like it (color temp, color level, brightness/contrast, sharpness, etc) and has a few different sound settings built in also you can change between.

I have bought TV's in the past that I returned because I simply did not like something about them. not this one, this is a very good entry/mid level TV for the price.",B09R6QH7XG,Love the picture!,Size: 65 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"This is our second TCL TV. We bought a 55 inch TCL about four years ago and it has been an outstanding unit. Around the same time we bought a 50 inch Sharp Roku TV that honestly neither of us was ever 100% happy with. It just seemed very unstable and glitchy with the controls and the picture wasn’t that great either.

This TCL arrived in a timely manner the box was perfect and the TV was very easy to unpack and set up. Probably less than 20 minutes. The sound is good the picture is very good.

The one and only thing I would improve relates to the one feature of the Sharp TV that I really did like. There is only one audio out jack which is for headphones. When you plug in headphones the built-in speakers are unenabled. That was one nice feature of the sharp TV, it had a direct audio out and a separate headphone jack so I could listen on my headphones while my wife listened on the speakers because my hearing is not as good as hers. Other than that one thing we are very happy with the TCL unit and would recommend it .",B09R6QH7XG,Great TV,Size: 55 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Might not be the best picture quality available, but it is pretty dang good. If you are upgrading from an older TV (5ys+ old) this picture will be incredible to you. I have recently purchased a 55"" Sony Bravo as well (the connectivity options and sound quality on the Bravo are far better) and when I first got it, I had them side-by-side and honestly thought the TCL had a better picture with my HD cable. Blu-ray, I couldn't see a difference. In short, buy a high quality sound bar (ARC) for this TV and you are still at half the price of the comparably-size Bravo. Fantastic deal. This review will probably upset the electronic snobs out there, but most people don't care that there are 10 picture settings in a TV and aren't going to take the time to switch the setting depending on every viewing situation they are in.

"Hoping this helps with your decisions.

So, wish we had vid/pic the product to post along with this review. Package was in the simple original carton only. That said, UPS handled it very well as there were zero damage or wear to the carton at all & we gladly accepted the delivery.
The carton gave instructions on how to open the TV the easiest and safest. It was inner wrapped in plastic with an additional thick foam and cardboard shield between the carton and protected screen.
Every item was attached to find easily & no loss or damage.

The set itself is a great economical entry/midrange tv. Picture is on par and the bundled Roku software lends many viewing options. Wireless network setup on TV is easy especially bc we knew our password. Its not clear if any push to connect option was available as we don’t allow that option on our residential wireless. Hardwire network option is available, though our wireless is substantial to hold and serve many endpoints.
Updates were automatically verified and then the Roku app setup begins with simple date time and zipcode verification. If you are familiar it is identical as a external Roku setup. If not familiar, Roku is easy to navigate and select or deselect channels and setup.
You will find 4 HDMI ports one supporting (ARC). If you aren’t familiar with hdmi(arc) devices, suggest you Google else you will miss out on a optional device interface, like controlling a sound bar.
Speaking of sound bar… my only “con” about this set is the rather ‘cheap’ sound it produces by itself. Actually the sound isn’t too bad for a down and back firing sound. I assume the reason for the speaker position is more for wall mounting (not included) and provide a sleek frontal look with a equally 1/2” ‘borderless appearance.
If you plan to use the factory feet/stand just know your lower clearance is around 2” from bottom of set to your counter, tv stand top. Making the audio sound seem a little strange, however you will acclimate to the bass lacking internal sound.
The set itself, it is rather light in comparison to older LCD/LED/Plasma.
A feature beyond a cable box remote controller, enjoyed by our family is the direct ability to adjust volume from the simple Roku remote included.

"This Roku TV is an excellent deal for $300. I honestly was not expecting much for that price. The image quality is really good considering how much it costs.

I am also really pleased with Roku. Prior to this I had a smart TV that was not Roku. It really adds a lot of different channels and free apps for infinite things to view. If you have app subscriptions already you can just sign in, it doesn't charge you extra. It also loads really quickly.
As far as regular cable TV I haven't figured out how to pause, rewind, fast forward or any other features yet, which were advertised with the Roku program.

"The TCL roku tv is the best interface on earth for cord cutters. Why? Because once you hook this tv to a good antenna, you will not only get a great picture but a menu. Not just any menu to view what is on tv right now, but a menu to show you what is coming up. TCL is so high tech for cord cutters, by adding a USB drive to the tv you can pause live tv. This is amazing. imagine watching your favorite show but you need a bathroom break. Just press pause and when you come back you can resume. What an amazing free feature. Now if you have internet in your home you will also get free tv channels. At least a hundred free stations that are a part of your guide. Its basically like having basic cable without a monthly fee. The tv will pay for itself in 12 months. About the sound, it is high end sound. You can use headphones and a sound bar but the sound is really good and immersive. About the picture, I suggest you go to sports mode. Go to settings and put it on sports mode because it will be operating in 120 motion mode and the picture quality is great and bright with great contrast. You will get your best picture in sports mode. The best sound is when you go to sound settings and combine the bass with enhanced sound for speech. it is just a button click. In my opinion, if you are a cord cutter a TCL tv has the best combination of features, sound and picture quality.

"I’m a week and ½ into the TCL series 4, 65 inch ownership experience. I’m really pleased up to this point.
I replaced a 55 inch LG which simply stopped working. I had been doing research on new flat screens because the LG was acting funny and I wanted to be prepared. I had a ROKU device attached to the LG so the choice of a ROKU TV was a given. I do like the O.S. and user interface.
Pretty plain, but that’s the nature of all flat screens. It’s simple plain plastic frame with nothing taking up screen real estate. There is a button on the front bottom that allows control of the device if you lose the remote. I bought a spare non OEM remote for $5.00, I would recommend it. The remote combined with the ROKU interface has a lot of options in spite of the remote only having a few buttons. I do miss numbers on the remote however.
So the weirdness is the default settings. When I turned it on the initial impression was the screen was not bright and actually kind of flat and boring. After learning all the settings I found one that was set to “low power.” I flipped it to “normal” and a brilliant picture showed up. The same goes for the sound. I set that to theater and a clear more dynamic sound arrived. I don’t know why TCL would set a default to a sub optional setting, but they did. Of course the product literature was of limited value, just had to experiment.
I like it so far!",B09R6QH7XG,Good for the price,Size: 32 inStyle: Android TV,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I replaced another brand for this larger screen TV. Everything is OK. The low price captured me, but I should have read reviews to understand upfront that the picture quality is ""good"", NOT VERY GOOD, or WOW that's sharp. But is certainly suffices. No bang, wow, oh boy TV picture for sure. But then you pay a few hundred to several hundred more for that. Right? IT's acceptable.

Only issue I have found is that the built in speakers are sub optimal, you will need to provide better speakers, in order to get good full range sound.

"Bought this TV to replace a 6 year old Samsung. Very happy with it.
As others have said, if you want the best TV to hook up your $1500 gaming pc to or play the best of the best Xbox series X games on at the highest settings, you can find better tvs (for a lot more money)

But if you want a very good TV to watch sports, streaming, movies and regular shows, this is great.

I'm a bit puzzled as to why others said the TV sound is bad. We have another 4-5 year old TCL tv, and this tv sounds much better. We even have a $200 sound bar hooked up to the old tv....I tried hooking that soundbar up to this TV and it was only a slight improvement over the speakers in the TV.
Of course, buy yourself an expensive soundbar or one with a seperate subwoofer and it will sound better, but this TV for sure sounds better than similar TVs just a couple years old.

The Biggest thing I was concerned about was the Roku smart TV features. We have a Cable app built in (as we did on our old Samsung TV) and it responded VERY slowly on the Samsung. Happy to say it is much quicker on the TV.

In the menu it does have various settings so you can get the picture quality to just how you like it (color temp, color level, brightness/contrast, sharpness, etc) and has a few different sound settings built in also you can change between.

I have bought TV's in the past that I returned because I simply did not like something about them. not this one, this is a very good entry/mid level TV for the price.",B09R6SWKMW,Great TV!,Size: 40 inStyle: Android TV,5.0 out of 5 stars
"This is our second TCL TV. We bought a 55 inch TCL about four years ago and it has been an outstanding unit. Around the same time we bought a 50 inch Sharp Roku TV that honestly neither of us was ever 100% happy with. It just seemed very unstable and glitchy with the controls and the picture wasn’t that great either.

This TCL arrived in a timely manner the box was perfect and the TV was very easy to unpack and set up. Probably less than 20 minutes. The sound is good the picture is very good.

The one and only thing I would improve relates to the one feature of the Sharp TV that I really did like. There is only one audio out jack which is for headphones. When you plug in headphones the built-in speakers are unenabled. That was one nice feature of the sharp TV, it had a direct audio out and a separate headphone jack so I could listen on my headphones while my wife listened on the speakers because my hearing is not as good as hers. Other than that one thing we are very happy with the TCL unit and would recommend it .",B09R6SWKMW,Few annoyances. Overall good.,Size: 32 inStyle: Android TV,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Might not be the best picture quality available, but it is pretty dang good. If you are upgrading from an older TV (5ys+ old) this picture will be incredible to you. I have recently purchased a 55"" Sony Bravo as well (the connectivity options and sound quality on the Bravo are far better) and when I first got it, I had them side-by-side and honestly thought the TCL had a better picture with my HD cable. Blu-ray, I couldn't see a difference. In short, buy a high quality sound bar (ARC) for this TV and you are still at half the price of the comparably-size Bravo. Fantastic deal. This review will probably upset the electronic snobs out there, but most people don't care that there are 10 picture settings in a TV and aren't going to take the time to switch the setting depending on every viewing situation they are in.

"Hoping this helps with your decisions.

So, wish we had vid/pic the product to post along with this review. Package was in the simple original carton only. That said, UPS handled it very well as there were zero damage or wear to the carton at all & we gladly accepted the delivery.
The carton gave instructions on how to open the TV the easiest and safest. It was inner wrapped in plastic with an additional thick foam and cardboard shield between the carton and protected screen.
Every item was attached to find easily & no loss or damage.

The set itself is a great economical entry/midrange tv. Picture is on par and the bundled Roku software lends many viewing options. Wireless network setup on TV is easy especially bc we knew our password. Its not clear if any push to connect option was available as we don’t allow that option on our residential wireless. Hardwire network option is available, though our wireless is substantial to hold and serve many endpoints.
Updates were automatically verified and then the Roku app setup begins with simple date time and zipcode verification. If you are familiar it is identical as a external Roku setup. If not familiar, Roku is easy to navigate and select or deselect channels and setup.
You will find 4 HDMI ports one supporting (ARC). If you aren’t familiar with hdmi(arc) devices, suggest you Google else you will miss out on a optional device interface, like controlling a sound bar.
Speaking of sound bar… my only “con” about this set is the rather ‘cheap’ sound it produces by itself. Actually the sound isn’t too bad for a down and back firing sound. I assume the reason for the speaker position is more for wall mounting (not included) and provide a sleek frontal look with a equally 1/2” ‘borderless appearance.
If you plan to use the factory feet/stand just know your lower clearance is around 2” from bottom of set to your counter, tv stand top. Making the audio sound seem a little strange, however you will acclimate to the bass lacking internal sound.
The set itself, it is rather light in comparison to older LCD/LED/Plasma.
A feature beyond a cable box remote controller, enjoyed by our family is the direct ability to adjust volume from the simple Roku remote included.
All in all…this is an excellent value. It’s not a set to ‘crow about up and down the neighborhood, on NFL superbowl weekend HOWEVER you will not be embarrassed by this set in anyway. Kid to the in-laws will love it.

"I’m a week and ½ into the TCL series 4, 65 inch ownership experience. I’m really pleased up to this point.
I replaced a 55 inch LG which simply stopped working. I had been doing research on new flat screens because the LG was acting funny and I wanted to be prepared. I had a ROKU device attached to the LG so the choice of a ROKU TV was a given. I do like the O.S. and user interface.
Pretty plain, but that’s the nature of all flat screens. It’s simple plain plastic frame with nothing taking up screen real estate. There is a button on the front bottom that allows control of the device if you lose the remote. I bought a spare non OEM remote for $5.00, I would recommend it. The remote combined with the ROKU interface has a lot of options in spite of the remote only having a few buttons. I do miss numbers on the remote however.
So the weirdness is the default settings. When I turned it on the initial impression was the screen was not bright and actually kind of flat and boring. After learning all the settings I found one that was set to “low power.” I flipped it to “normal” and a brilliant picture showed up. The same goes for the sound. I set that to theater and a clear more dynamic sound arrived. I don’t know why TCL would set a default to a sub optional setting, but they did.

"[This is adapted from my review on code.Antrikshy.com]

I put off writing this review for so long because my thoughts on this TV are not easy to compile into words. This review is the culmination of very heavy use over a whole quarter, me ruminating over all aspects of this product, and several conversations I've had with different people about this purchase.

To help set the stage, perhaps I should start with my profile as a consumer. In summary:

- I am very discerning about picture quality. many hours over days to get picture modes and settings *just* right on a new TV.
- I am extremely particular about user experience in software. Part of my professional work happens to involve some UX design.
- I watch a lot of movies. And I mean... A LOT. Hundreds per year.
- I tend to use my TVs very heavily. In the work-from-home world, I have this TV on for more than half of my waking hours of an average work day.

When my 2016 Vizio P-Series gave up after 5 years of heavy use, I set off on my journey of picking just the right successor. I settled on what many reviewers consider the absolute best TV for movies (thanks Rtings, Digital Trends, others). This excludes exorbitantly expensive models, and the Sony A80J. That one was significantly more expensive at the time of my purchase. As a bonus, the LG C1 came with cutting edge gaming features like modern VRR support, new HDMI standards, low input latency and whatnot.

I briefly considered buying one of those newfangled mini-LED models from LG and Samsung for their benefits - no risk of burn-in, extremely high brightness (for my sometimes bright living room). I decided against them as:

- Mini-LED new and I'd rather let the market settle and develop before committing. Speaking of new panel tech, I have fingers crossed for micro-LED panels.
- I saw an LG mini-LED (aka QNED) in person at Best Buy and I wasn't blown away by it, even in comparison with their standard LED-lit LCD panels.
- Samsung doesn't support Dolby Vision at all, so I dropped them from consideration entirely. I find DV very noticeably better than HDR10, and I happen to consume a lot of DV content from Netflix, Disney+ etc.
- I was sort of envious of OLED panels after hearing people rave about them for years.
- My usage patterns don't have me that concerned about OLED burn-in.

----- The Good -----

The display on this TV is absolutely phenomenal. There's no other way to put it. No asterisks, no buts.

Paired with a mid-range surround audio setup, my movie watching experience at home is now better than my local movie theaters. The washed out blacks from those projectors no longer cut it.

Gaming is a blast. While I wait on a long HDMI cable to connect my gaming PC, I've been enjoying my PlayStation 5 with the LG C1. Spider-Man Remastered, and especially Spider-Man Miles Morales are glorious on this thing. I've had some of the most gorgeous video game experiences of my life in the first quarter of living with this LG C1. From my secondary research, all HDMI ports support all the fancy features, and are all low enough latency for gaming.

A common criticism for OLED panels is their dimness. Coming from a 2016 Vizio LCD which often struggled on brighter afternoons, I had concerns about this. Turns out, the reflectivity and anti-glare treatments of these panels play a huge role in usability under bright conditions. OLEDs may look like dark mirrors, but let me tell you - at least the C1 does a solid job of canceling glare. I was relieved to learn this. Even with lower brightness measurements from Rtings.com, I found the C1 outperforming my 2016 Vizio P-Series. I wouldn't complain if it was brighter, but it performs admirably in all lighting conditions in my home.

The speakers built into the C1 are excellent. You can get away without an external audio system (unless you use DTS audio; see below). However, I'd recommend using one regardless. It would be a shame to spend this much cash on this fancy of a display and not pair it with an audio upgrade.

I should mention that my old Vizio was high end at the time, with a $2000 MSRP. I'm sure I would pick the OLED display in blind tests every time, but it's not a night-and-day difference. Subjectively, I'd say there's about a 15% bump in picture quality coming from a fancy LCD with active local dimming from 2016, although with much better reflection handling.

----- The Bad -----

That's about where the good stuff ends.

Note that the 2016 Vizio I came from was a beast of a TV for the time. It supported basically every major standard I could possibly care about and more. The Vizio supported:

- All HDR standards of the time, from Dolby Vision to HDR10 (support for both was actually rare at the time), and HLG.
- Pretty much every audio format, between Dolby and DTS.
- Chromecast (built-in).
- AirPlay, which was added years after purchase, something I don't expect from any TV manufacturer for a model that old.
- Alexa and Google Assistant remote control, another couple of standards that weren't present at launch but added later. This even included setting the volume to specific numbers, switching picture modes and more.

In comparison, the LG C1 didn't look good out of the box. In summary, some things it didn't support or do as well:

- LG straight up does not support DTS audio. DTS is very common on Blu-rays and DVDs. This means that if you buy this $2000+ TV, you cannot hook up a Blu-ray player and play any disc and expect to hear audio. I knew this going in, and work around it by passing my Blu-ray player input through my audio system (can only do this for 1 device max).
- Alexa support is abysmal. I mean actually atrocious. I don't understand how a company like LG can release software in this condition on a $2000+ device. Just setting up the Echo integration is so painful, I just gave up after days of trying. Documentation is unclear, there are multiple Alexa skills, the TV is not detected cleanly in my list of devices from Alexa's perspective, and it stops working after some period of time as a bonus. I imagine Google Assistant isn't too different. LG should be ashamed of advertising any Alexa integration on the box.
- There is no Chromecast built-in. I can't blame LG for Vizio spoiling me; this is very uncommon.

In addition to those, the stock software has a TON of issues. I know built-in app interfaces are seldom performant and smooth, but my issues with LG's WebOS goes deeper into the software.

It actively causes issues with HDMI devices because of how the menu system is designed.

There is no way to make the home screen with the app library the default view on power on. It's just an overlay that slides up when on home button press. This means that when the C1 is powered on, it defaults to the last used HDMI input, LG's live streaming channels, or live TV. If it powers on on an HDMI input, it also sends a power on request over CEC. This causes whatever you used last to power on, no matter the device you actually want to use. With my Blu-ray player or PlayStation 5, it requires me to wait for the several seconds worth of boot up sequence before I can shut them down. There is no way to turn this off in the TV.

So if I primarily watch streaming content through apps, I cannot make a grid of apps appear on boot. The C1 *insists* on powering on my Blu-ray player or PlayStation, whichever I used last. The only solution was to disable CEC *entirely* on my Blu-ray player (not ideal) and make sure I remember to switch inputs every time I turn the TV off. The only other alternative was to buy a streaming box and make it my HDMI ""sink"" device as a scapegoat that powers on when I turn the TV on.

It's like LG *wants* me to not use their built-in menus and apps.

Here's a grab bag of other issues:

- Most menus and help text in the WebOS interface use broken English, full of grammatical errors. I understand LG is a Korean company, but it still irks me to see this in a $2000+ product from a brand that has global reach. It makes the entire thing feel like a knock-off from AliExpress.
- Built-in Alexa (via the button on the remote) very often just doesn't connect to servers. When it does, there's a solid lag between button press and listening.
- Built-in apps just crash from time to time. Disney+ is notorious for its poor performance on a lot of hardware. This TV is no exception.
- There is no way to force quit apps, or even fully shut down the TV without pulling the plug on it. I have had Prime Video crash on me a couple of times such that the only solution was to not use it until the TV's OS decides to quit it in the background, *or* I decide to uninstall and reinstall the app and sign into it again. And no, powering the TV off using the remote just puts it in some kind of sleep mode until the TV feels like shutting off.
- I have an Ethernet cable plugged into my C1. The mobile app cannot control the TV over this connection. No no, you see, that requires a Wi-Fi connection. Bit odd, but no worries, why not keep both connected? Well, the Wi-Fi connection is not persistent. It disconnects either on every power off or arbitarily (I'm unsure) and requires me to manually go into the menu tree to reconnect each time.
- The home screen is ugly and generally stuttery. There are some ads present, but they can be disabled in the menus. I've seen photos of WebOS from last year before the 2021 redesign, and it looks *way* prettier and utilitarian. Without personal experience with it, I envy the people who bought 2020 models. Fortunately for them, LG abandons models within the year when it comes to major redesigns.

The Magic Remote, I was actually looking forward to. the air-wavy-pointer thing seemed intriguing. It was useful, and fun to use, but also very poorly thought out. Moreover its added value is limited because all the streaming apps are already designed for a traditional directional-controls-with-select-button control.

I was disappointed to see a huge bulky remote, until I started using it. Turns out, pretty good ergonomics! But that got old fast as I couldn't fit it in my pocket easily. I'd much rather have a smaller and lighter remote without extraneous buttons. Also, app shortcuts? Really? Advertisements on a remote I paid over $2000 for? Unacceptable.

The select button also happens to be a scroll wheel. When using the remote in ""traditional"" mode, without a pointer, if I accidentally turn the scroll wheel when trying to press select, it summons the pointer. The only ways to get rid of the pointer? Either press one of the directional buttons (which causes interactions with the running app) or just... keep the remote still for several seconds.

Waving or shaking the remote also brings up the pointer. This means if I put the (bulky!) remote in my pocket and walk to the kitchen, that may summon the uninvited guest, which starts floating around all over the screen with each stride, bringing up player controls in whatever app I'm using.

Both these things, and the lack of a pointer-toggle button on the remote made me too conscious of using the remote at all. I had to cradle it like a child so as to not summon the dreaded pointer.

----- The Redemption - Get a Streaming Box -----

I am glad to report that *most* of these issues are resolved by getting the right streaming box for it. There's no excuse. This should not be necessary for a TV that's this expensive. But, here we are.

I had a Fire TV Stick 4K (2019) lying around. Unfortunately, for mysterious reasons, the model from that year does not support Dolby Atmos on Netflix (and only on Netflix). I have an Atmos sound system, and I wouldn't settle. After much research, I got an Apple TV. It fixed my ""default HDMI sink"" problem. Now I had a ""default"" device, so to speak, that I could switch to before powering the TV off. When I powered the TV on, it would just turn on the Apple TV.

Unfortunately, I wasn't a huge fan of the interface, controls nor the remote. Voice control was incredibly subpar. I expected to be able to do more, and more seamlessly from my iPhone and Apple Watch. The touchpad on the remote was more hindrance than help. I returned it.

While I was at it, I decided to try out Google TV with the Nvidia Shield for some variety before resorting to a newer model Fire TV. Unlike Chromecast with Google TV, Nvidia's box promised Alexa control.

I named it ""Living Room TV"", deleted every trace of LG setup from my Alexa profile, and it works nearly perfectly.

It handles turning the LG C1 on and off over CEC quite seamlessly, even when I ask Alexa via Echo devices. It also supports more specific things like opening apps and rewinding by arbitrary time periods. It's not quite as smooth as Fire TV control is but it's very close. And I now have a default HDMI device, so I don't have to worry about the stupid LG C1 turning on my PlayStation or Blu-ray player.

As a bonus, Google TV on the Nvidia Shield supports Chromecast, something my parents missed from the old Vizio when they came over.

----- The Conclusion -----

I wall-mount my TV because of unsightly power sockets high up on my wall. If it was not so difficult to unmount this thing and pack it back into the box, I would have returned it a couple weeks in.

Now that the Nvidia Shield has solved *most* of my issues, the C1 is in a passable, usable state. The screen remains jaw-droppingly beautiful. All I've learned from the rest of the experience is to not buy LG in the future.

Buy this TV if all of the following are true:

1. You plan on either using *only* the built-in apps and no HDMI devices, or HDMI devices of which one is a streaming box that you don't mind powering on each time you turn on the TV.
2. You don't care about Alexa control, or the native Alexa integration built into the TV and remote.
3. You don't mind all the issues with the Magic Remote I've outlined above.
4. You have acknowledged issues with OLED displays in general, such as burn-in.
5. You don't plan on watching anything with DTS audio, or have a separate audio system that can decode it. This should not be an issue with most if not all streaming services; they tend to use Dolby.",B08WG4HKKY,Great TV!,Size: 55 inchStyle: TV Only,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I’m asking for comments. Can someone talk me down off the ledge? What am I missing? I'd be thrilled to be wrong about this.

Overall
Yup the picture quality is excellent and I guess that's why you pay top dollar for this premium TV. But I am crushingly disappointed by the quirky remote, the clunky user interface, the slim LD TV offerings and high latency when accessing LD TV, the uninspired selection of available apps, the superficial flexibility in choosing apps, the lack of customizability on several levels, the constant software updates, the inadequate instructional manuals, and the poor (or no) connectivity to the two other things I've tried to connect. More minor, I find the TV’s embedded marketing features to be irritating just on principle. I researched the heck out of this before I bought it and I'm seriously considering returning it. The only thing that makes me even consider keeping it is that connecting an Apple TV unit provides work-arounds for the worst flaws. What am I missing?

For background, this replaces an old (2004? 2005?) LG Plasma that, with an Apple TV unit, worked extremely well though the picture quality was poor and I wanted a larger screen. And yes, my internet connection is excellent: the TV is next to a satellite for a high-end WiFi 6 mesh router with 1G internet connection. And yes, I still have a cable box to which the TV is connected (hard wired).

Here's what I didn't know and what you ought to and if anyone can help with any of this please lmk as I’ve googled until I cant google anymore:

Aspect Ratio/ Picture Zoom: This is a Big Deal

The Owners Manual states clearly that it is bad for the screen to have long periods where there are black bars on the top or sides (causes burn out), and suggests that you adjust the picture zoom/ aspect ratio when needed to extend the picture so that you don’t have the black bars. Fine. Alas, the ability to zoom or to adjust the aspect ratio is cancelled out when using many apps (such as YouTube) and when casting to the TV via Airplay 2 from your Iphone or Ipad. And Iphone and Ipad images are never sized correctly for the screen. This is a huge issue for me as I use the TV for Zoom meetings and classes a lot; Zoom meetings come in with large black areas at the bottom, top and sides. LG explains the inability to change the aspect ratio by a note to the effect that the providers of these services have decided not to make this functionality available, and my argument is with them, not with LG. But when I connect my Apple TV module, and use it to access YouTube, or screen mirror from my Ios devices to the Apple TV module instead of to the TV directly, I can adjust the picture size and aspect ratio. Dear LG: Your messaging says that all this is attributable to the source: That YouTube, Zoom etc don’t want the user to be able to adjust the view. But Apple TV has figured this out. Why this ability is not native to the TV is beyond my understanding.

I have the same issue when I use some of the other apps that are native to the TV, including Hulu. I can’t size the picture to take up the entire screen when I access these services through the TV, but I can do so when I access them via Apple TV.

My cable remote has a handy button that quickly enlarges (or reduces) the picture size when you tap it. I was able to use the cable remote to control every aspect of my old LG TV, including changing the source from cable to Apple TV. But this new LG TV won’t allow the cable remote to do much more than turn it on/off and adjust the volume unless I am watching something through the cable box; I certainly can’t use it to enlarge picture size.

I tried to access the Zoom meeting website through the TV's web browser. No tpossible because I would have had to download the Zoom client and the LG TV has zero memory and does not offer the Zoom client as an app. I have a cheap Samsung UHD TV from 2018 that has enough memory to support a number of apps, but this expensive TV has zero memory. Really?

So this is what I have to do to use Zoom. 1. Turn on the TV, press “Home” and use the TV remote to select the Apple TV. 2. Turn on the Apple TV with its remote (more later: they cant turn on as one). 3. Turn on my Ios device, open the Zoom client, and log into the meeting. 4. Screen mirror my Ios device to the Apple TV unit. (4.5 Optional: Use the Apple TV remote to cast the sound to my Sonos One speaker) 5. Use the TV remote to go to settings / picture/ aspect ratio/ 4-way zoom and enlarge the picture to eliminate the black bars. Two remotes, and 3 devices to achieve this. Really?

Connectivity: Sonos and Alexa: Problems, Problems, Problems

The reviews I read warned that not all Sonos speakers will connect directly, but that you can connect via Airplay 2. Nope. Not to Sonos One and not to several other Sonos models that don’t have bluetooth. But I can use my Sonos One speakers when I connect through my Apple TV unit. What the heck? I have a $2,000 LG TV and have to purchase a $150 device from another company to have full functionality?

Alexa: connectivity to Alexa seemed fine at first. But then an Alexa reminder I had made happened. The reminder popped up on the LG TV screen in an unattractive visual format, blocking about 40% of the picture. Turns out, if you connect Alexa, THERE IS NO WAY TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING. So you can’t hook up Alexa and then customize it to say “don’t show visual reminders on the TV”. This is a total deal killer for us and we had to un-pair Alexa.

Available Apps and Memory: Not Many, and None

On my $400 Samsung, you can search for apps in addition to the ones that are pre-loaded and download the ones you want. You can’t have an infinite number due to memory constraints but you can have a satisfying number. LG makes it appear that you can choose some apps but when you go to do it you quickly realize that there are only 7 or 8 available and they are only the ones that LG has somehow decided to offer. Yes, the TV comes pre-loaded with the big ones, but there are a lot of apps it doesn’t have and now I have to use the Apple TV unit to get them.

This TV has no memory. So you cant go on the internet or to an app store and download the apps you want. This is a drag.

It also means that pausing and rewinding live TV is not possible. I can do it when I use my cable box, and I can do it – though clunky – using some of the LG TV apps such as YouTube. I can do it on anything I access though my Apple TV module.

The Remote: Bad Magic

The “magic” in the “magic remote” is a cursor that appears as a pointer on the screen. Sometimes. It comes. It goes. When it’s there the other navigation controls for the screen don’t all work. I have gotten somewhat used to it but overall would be happier without the “magic”.

Figuring out what channel you are currently watching, what’s next up on this channel, and what’s on right now on other channels is laborious. My cable remote lets me do it by just clicking on the right or left (or top or bottom) side of a circle that surrounds the “enter” button. This LG remote has the wheel but it doesn’t work this way. You have to hit s special button for the embedded guide and scroll through it. HUGE DRAG. This could and should be corrected with a software upgrade.

The voice remote is iffy. Say I want to change the aspect ratio. When I click on the microphone button and say “change aspect ratio” it usually pulls up a selection of YouTube videos that might be relevant to this topic. Every now and again, it opens the TV’s settings near the aspect ratio menu. Can’t figure it out. Obviously the former is useless.

There are several ‘secret menus” on the remote to change things and you can only find out about these by googling and watching interminable YouTube videos. I don’t have the energy to explain more here but trust me – its true. And its obnoxious. I have a complicated phone that came with a 70-page owners manual but at least I can actually find stuff I need to know there. This has no manual and no mention of this kind of thing in any of the owners materials.

Oh – on my old LG – I could pair my cable remote to the TV and just use the cable remote for everything. Can’t do that here. I hear you can purchase from LG an older remote. Maybe that would be better. But it sucks to have to pay for it.

Conclusion

"I bought this tv since it gets very high praise for gaming use. I am replacing a samsung 4k tv that was about 2.5 years old(it had a total failure). I am playing a ps5 on this LG and for gaming, it is really impressive and lives up to the hype 100%.
As of typing this all the software is updated.
Where to begin…. The general menus are very slow, frustratingly slow, I have to just type again Slow. Some times while navigating a streaming service app button presses can be 2-5 seconds lagging behind. Settings menus take seconds to load. Yes, we are talking about mere seconds but when it is all the time on a brand new tv that is not from a bargain bin, it gets frustrating. Should the tv picture setting menu take 4-5 seconds to load every time, then each sub menu each needing another few seconds? It is surprising really.
I really got a lot of use out of the samsung “tv” channels function. They had maybe 50ish channels of random shows, nothing great and certainly a free tier quality but still, it was there. LG has a similar “tv” option. Again, we are faced with the Very slow navigation through the guide, everything has to load and feels slow. It makes my previous lower end samsung look blazing fast!? Also, the LG “tv” function really relies on Pluto. You are presented with a familiar tv guide navigation and can go to a show. Only with LG most of the shows stop after maybe 30 seconds and prompts you to install and use Pluto to continue watching. Samsung had no Pluto or other apps required to use their “tv” function that I know of. On the LG there is no way to filter out which channels require pluto and which do not. Kind of makes the function useless if you decide not to use Pluto so I am not sure why it even exists? An LG skin ontop of Pluto, another layer of stuff to slow down? I used the samsung version pretty often so that is a feature I already miss.
Setup was kind of an annoyance for me. You have to setup each type of picture separate, HDR, SDR and Dolby Vision have to be accessed all separately. While adjusting the settings you must have the source material playing to access. IE you can’t go setting by setting and have access to all of them. If you want to adjust or even view the HDR settings you need an HDR video playing. Again, menu slowness while going through settings and in/out of menus while you adjust are just painfully slow. The “apply to all sources” only applies the current settings option to all sources. I like the Filmaker mode and motion smoothing turned off and wanted to apply that to hdr/sdr/dolby to all sources, nope, have to load separate content to access each settings one at a time. Making minor adjusts, is a hassle to get them matching across all apps/video sources. Apply to all sources also becomes useless if you forget to turn off on the settings that tries to guess the content and adjust itself. Yes, I want to apply this certain setting to all inputs just to have the tv instead try to predict what setting it thinks I would want!? If apply to all inputs is used it should turn off the self adjust setting…
I have had apps such os Discovery+, Paramount+ just crash, often. In the middle of a show the screen goes black for a few seconds and you are put back into the Home menu. Painful slow loading of the menu with button lag forces you to reload the app and find your place again. No error messages come up to be able to search?
I have used a Klipsch soundbar routed through hdmi ARC for a while with no real issue. With this LG the sound bar loses connection and defaults back to built in speakers often. I have to power on/off the sound bar or unplug its power to get the tv to recognize it again. The built in speakers may as well really just not be there, they are bad, please don’t use them. Also, volume levels across apps is horrible. Going from say Paramount+ to Youtube will cause a jarring jump in volume. Settings are all the same(using hdmi arc really removes all tv audio settings). It is 2022, I should not have to scramble to turn the volume half way down simple going between 2 apps. I never had volume issues with this soundbar before.
The web browser is also very poor, some networks don’t seem to have apps and force browser viewing so it is good to have an option. I have had the browser stop play back and tell me it has run out of memory and can not play back the video…. Out of memory!? It has been easier casting browser based shows from my phone than deal with the LG browser.
The actual OLED image quality is amazing and has been the best looking tv I have ever owned. Playing games on a ps5 looks just amazing. Watching HDR 4k movies is also amazing. The overall TV usage however is just a very very Very poor experience for me. Crashing apps, slow apps, slow menus, forced Pluto tv use, horrible web browser, volume jumps between apps etc. I hope other companies take on OLED tech more, I can honestly not see myself getting another LG tv after this first experience with one.
Try before you buy if you can or just go into it for gaming.
Update: 4/21/22
More app crashes randomly made me decide to take another star off the review. Every major streaming app has now had random crashes.

Update 6/19/22
Sound is still an issue. The sound bar continues to disconnect randomly.
Today a new sound issue came up however. Before the new sound issue No settings were changed, nothing new was plugged into the tv, just zero change to anything. The sound suddenly stopped working on all outputs, zero sound. Turned the tv on/off a few times, no sound. Cycled through all out puts and options, zero sound. Full disconnected the sound bar(hdmi and sound bar power), no sound. I had to unplug the tv power to get sound back. Again, a tv in 2022 and I am having to unplug it to resolve a sound out put problem, just more and more disappointment with this tv.",B08WG4HKKY,"A quarter in, I have 2400+ words of thoughts on the LG C1",Size: 65 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought the 48"" version in February of 2022. And after roughly 2,000 hours of use, I'm glad I did.

It sits on a desk as a PC monitor, and the screen size is spot on. (The desk itself is 31"" deep, so the OLED is a mere inches away from arms length.) I also use an LG OLED C9 as a television in the living room, so I knew what to expect as far as perfect black levels, color accuracy pop, great contrast, and subpar performance in bright surroundings.

The built-in speakers aren't much to write home about, but at my sitting distance from the C1, it comes across with depth and clarity. I was impressed. The metal stand deflects the output from the downward, Atmos drivers - and it actually works. (I can't say the same thing about the C9 at a viewing distance of six feet, but that's the main reason I picked up a soundbar for it.)

The setting to edit input viewing mode, found in the Home Dashboard menu, allows you to switch between PC, Blu-Ray, streaming box, DVD, cable, etc. - and the picture and motion settings will adjust according to the source material. And it works very well. Throw in WiFi and four HDMI 2.1 ports, and I'm a content consumer.

I have only a couple of quibbles with the LG OLED48C1.

One. While the screen never dims while viewing/streaming content or playing video games, it does so when I'm using the TV as a PC monitor. This burn prevention setting kicks in whenever I'm writing for an extended time, whether it be a long email or this review (so far it hasn't, so maybe I should keep this short and sweet). You can get back to normal luminance, however, after a couple of taps on the Windows button of your keyboard. It's a peeve, but I get why it's there.

Two. (wait.... the screen just dimmed..... tapping.) If you use this with a version of Windows released before Windows 11, the default location of the Start Menu is a bit of a stretch to use. With this much screen real estate, it's uncomfortable. It's a tad like looking for the side view mirror in a car. (Luckily, Windows 11 has moved the menu to the center of the screen. Mac fans.. please, just don't.)

One star off for those reasons.

Still, the LG OLED48C1 is honestly the best and most impactful PC display I've ever used, and I doubt I'll ever go back to a traditional monitor again.",B08WG4HKKY,Great Picture but Otherwise a Huge Disappointment: Can Someone Talk Me down Off The Ledge?,Size: 55 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought this TV twice. The first time, I accidentally bought a 48” instead of a 55”. The 48” was fine since it was in my bedroom. Worked well for gaming on PS5 and XSX. Switches to game mode automatically. Blacks and Colors are deep and rich. Streaming works well with all the usual services without the need for a streaming box. The TV remote has a floating cursor function just like a wiimote, which makes some things easier to do. The only downside is that the picture might be too dark if placed in a living room or other bright space. I hear that the successor of this tv model, the C2, has addressed this issue, though seems to have a less sturdy base. About 10 months after getting the 48”, I moved it to the upstairs loft and bought a 65” on clearance, instead of buying a C2. I love it even more. Easy to see closed captions and less eye strain when gaming. My TV is probably 10-15 ft away from my head. Of course, this model will likely be replaced over the next year, but for 2021-2023, it’s great! Of note, I haven’t experienced any screen “burn-in”.",B08WG4HKKY,"Great gaming display, Horrible general tv experience.[Updated 6-19-22]",Size: 42 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"My previous TV died and I was sad. It was a Sharp Aquos that I'd had several years but the picture was still outstanding. For its time this TV was ahead of its competition. You'd think things would last forever like they used to but in todays throw away world its toss it in the dumpster and buy new. This is written two weeks into the LG.

Not that anyone cares, but I tend to research TV purchases to death. My first big screen I researched and read for five years before I purchased a Pioneer Elite 610 rear projection TV. It was great and when it died I was sad then too. The Sharp took its place and lived up to my expectations.

Since I'm a TV-aholic I needed a replacement when the Sharp died. My normal research was shortened a bit and from what I'd read from many sources, the LG seemed to fit my needs. Since we were on the downward phase of Covid (I hope) the US was seeing delivery issues and goods were sometimes in short supply. Local retailers did not have this TV in stock or it was promised within a couple weeks, maybe. So I decided to take a chance on buying through Amazon. It came within four days to my surprise.

Delivery was done by Amazon and unpacking and setup was handled by them as well. I must say I was very pleased with the setup. It included bringing it into my home, unpacking, placing the base on the TV and placing it where I wanted. They checked to be sure the TV came on and then removed the packaging. Very professional.

Reconnecting my surround system and video controller took me a while, lots of wires to sort out. Once connected to the internet, I stream now, and making some adjustments I was very pleased with the picture quality. There are many settings for video and you could even custom set color if that's your thing. Most people will find the settings supplied will suit their needs quite well. The sound from the LG speakers do amazingly well. I used it for several days with just these speakers and found them easy to hear voice. Since I'm older and listened to a lot of loud music when younger my hearing is not what it used to be. Kids today with their earbuds and headphones should really start to learn sign language now.

The other evening I watched LOTR The Fellowship of the Ring. This was not from DVD but from a broadcast over streaming that I'd saved. I was blown away as was my wife by the detail. Especially in the dark scenes where detail can be lost in the shadows. Not on this TV. Subtle details on steps in the mines, details of the Orcs and clothing were all there. And nothing was washed out in the deep darks. Blacks were black, midtones were spot on and highlights of flames or the glint on a sword were all there. If you have 4K content I'm sure you'd be very happy. I'll be watching some of my old DVD's again and see if they have stood the test of time.

I've read about people worrying about burn in since OLED's are supposed to be vulnerable to this. I can't imagine this happening unless you have a logo in the corner that doesn't go away. Still I feel you'd have to have it onscreen for hours before you'd see a problem. The TV does have an area in the menu called OLED care. It has something called Pixel Cleaning which is supposed to adjust each pixel to prevent burn in. Also a Screen Move function to move the screen a little at regular intervals for the same prevention. Do they work? Maybe but I'm not going to worry about it.

The photo I've added really can't do justice to the actual picture quality but the reflection in the silver cup caught my eye. And speaking of reflections, this TV will show reflections from windows or lights. You can still watch the TV just fine but no TV will kill all reflections from light sources. The room I'm in has room darkening shades so problem solved.

I'm sure over time I'll find more features to explore and will watch more 4K content to marvel over. For now I can recommend this TV for anyone that loves a spectacular picture. Is it pricey? Yes, but I've always felt you get what you pay for and I'm hoping this TV will last as long as the last one.",B08WG4HKKY,Best PC 'monitor' so far,Size: 65 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I don't usually write reviews but I just wanted to spread the word that this thing is superb! Especially if ur a fellow nerd with a next generation console (xbox series x). It literally looks like I'm playing a movie. Like I can reach in and grab the man's beard to pluck some hair from him. Also the picture for movies is even better!! Talk about feelin submerged. Also the volume is astounding without a system or sound bar and this is coming from a guy that used a huge Sony speakers until this purchase. It's appearance is smooth, very high class. Lastly I've seen complaints before buying on the remote????? Lol it's great fits the hand perfectly/comfortably , has quick access Netflix, amazon prime buttons and more, Alexa to tell a command, has a scroller to move around like a mouse, and Lastly ppl really didn't like the ""bulkyness"" of the remote and said it was cheaply made but it looks of fine quality to me and I like it being big.makes it harder to break, I'm rough on shit lol.

"This replaced a Samsung 60"" from 2017. That was an early model 4K and towards the lower end of the various Samsung lines. The picture from this compared to that is stunning - the blacks are the thing that really jump out. On a 4K Dolby Vision source it is revelatory.

What I can't comment on because we don't use:
- SmartTV features. We didn't use them with Samsung either - we use Google TV with Chromecast so that the UI is the same across TV brands and we aren't captive to a particular TV's UI. I also have low trust in the TV manufacturers to keep their Smart features updated. It is a lot cheaper to just replace the $50 Google device every couple years.
- HDMI/ARC. Sadly, our Denon AVR is too old for that.
- Internal speakers - never turned them on.
- Dolby beyond DD 5.1, i.e. Atmos, etc.

I do think that the documentation is mediocre and skinny at best - very basic stuff that you almost really don't need to know. Here are a few things it doesn't discuss:

- Surround sound from the optical/TOSLINK digital output: you can get DD 5.1 from this only if set to ""passthrough/bitstream"" Just about every other setting will result in PCM/2 channel because their thinking is that this is for a sound bar rather than an AVR, where you are more likely to use HDMI/ARC. We use the optical out because our AVR is too old to support ARC and doesn't support 4K either. So I struggled to get DD from the optical at first. I also had to set Google TV to ""auto"" rather than explicitly setting it to DD or DTS. I called up LG on this issue and they told me that only PCM was available on optical. That is not true. By contrast, the Samsung put everything to the AVR as DD 5.1, regardless of whether the upstream signal was that at all.

- The USB ports are switched, but with an off-delay. So if you want to power a gadget or LEDs know that the power will eventually shut off, just not when the TV is turned off.

- Relative to our Samsung, the screen is fairly reflective - this TV is not great near windows during the day. It is not as bright as our 5 year old Samsung either. But at night, ooo laa laa.

- This is an HDMI only TV - 1 rear-facing (HDMI 4) and 3 left facing - HDMI 1/2/3. No component or old RCA SD or S-Video. To set up our aging Denon you need RCA SD for the OSD when you aren't using HDMI. I bought a gadget here on Amazon to translate RCA video to HDMI for the rare times I need to get to the Denon's on screen menus. I do get griped by this - deciding to remove capabilities so that you need to upgrade and replace other components of your system that otherwise work fine.

- The OLED features aren't explained well. Like ""Comfort Mode"" for example. Does that help with OLED burn-in? Not sure. Some other OLED features are better described but I can't give a high score to the UI layout - too many options greyed out based on a setting elsewhere. I think the UI designers were challenged about balancing a feature's closeness to the top level menu versus closeness to more advanced settings.

- Calibration of any kind. Nada. Haven't touched that yet.

- The VESA mounting holes are very low on this TV. Not a big deal but be prepared to redo your wall mount if your prior TV was centered on the mounting holes.

That's all for now - just had it a week. This may sound nitpicky, but at the end of the day we are very happy with this TV.",B08WG4HKKY,"So Far, So Good",Size: 42 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"WORDY REVIEW WARNING - I have a 49"" Samsung Q70R I bought here on Amazon and the colors out of the box had a slight magenta tinge.

Bothersome to my eyes, and the grayish blacks and dirty screen effect didn't help. The flaws on that TV left a lot to be desired for me these last three years.

This 48"" LG C1 has way more accurate colors out of the box, correct enough to not warrant urgent calibration. It's just an impressive experience at 4K120 on my high-end PC both for new games and older ones.

The motion is so smooth and soothing to my eyes. I was in awe at how good HDR and Auto HDR looks. The sharpness is more evident. So much more per-pixel clarity.

I tried my PS3 and even on that old console the whole experience looked and felt different. Great upscaling from 720p. Gotta try it on my PS4 and Xbox 360 next.

Oh, the pictures and videos from my DJI Mavic 2 Pro and Air 2S look eye-wateringly impressive. This is how I originally yearned to experience them. 😭

I have AMOLED and p-OLED screens on my smartphones, but the blackness of the C1's screen is deeper than on my S22 Ultra or LG V60. It's black black, so the contrast is starker and more impressive even with less pixel density.

Better yet, waiting a year and a half saved me $703, too. Got it for $796.99 in July. The C2 on paper has upgrades and also downgrades from the C1, but apart from the faster processing, I know I wouldn't know the visual difference unless I had both side to side.
😃👍

Summary: The LG C1's color accuracy out of the box, motion smoothness, black depth, contrast and HDR had me emoting audibly, a first for me with a TV. 🥲

I haven't felt this awe before while gaming. This OLED TV looks like a window to another place. 4K native looks as sharp and almost as pixel-dense as 8K DSR on the Samsung Q70R.
My next TV has to be 8K OLED in three years from now...hopefully another LG.

Be well! 😁👍",B08WG4HKKY,It's amazing!!!,Size: 55 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I have my gaming PC and PS5 attached to this TV. (**I don't do any competitive gaming, just casual**). I mostly play first person shooters, and Simulators like DCS. Every game I have played has looked great on this TV. Picture quality is awesome. OLED is totally worth it in my opinion. Response times and refresh rates are great. Gsync and Variable refresh rates are nice to have. I never see any screen tearing when frame rates dip. HDR quality is good to. Watching full UHD + HDR movies on this TV is GREAT. The picture quality is better then any other TV I have owned. Better then my Samsung UHD 65 inch. I don't really use the smart apps, but I don't have anything negative to say about them. Just like most other TVs. The OS is snappy and not sluggish. It takes some getting used to the remote as a pointer / mouse. But that's optional. You can use the remote as a regular remote too.

My only complaint would be its needs more fully featured HDMI ports. If you want to use all the bells and whistles you may have to play musical chairs with the HDMI ports and your connected devices. OLEDs have a reputation to burn in faster. So I don't leave the TV on unless I'm using it. And certainly don't leave it on for long with with a static screen. But this is the reputation for OLED in general so I can't really say this is a complaint for this specific TV.

Just overall a good buy. Probably the best TV I've ever purchased relative to the tech out at the times of each TV purchase. I'm confident if you treat this TV right, it won't have any issues. LG has been on point with build quality as far as I have seen.",B08WG4HKKY,Stunning picture but mediocre documentation,Size: 65 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I've had my LG C1 for just about a year now and I can tell you a few things about having it:

It is amazing! All the rumors you've heard about the picture quality are true! Even the sound is pretty impressive for how thin this thing is!

The 4 HDMI ports are super as they are all 2.1, made for gaming.

The remote control is way easy to use and even a bit customizable.

I've had a little trouble with using a TCL Alto i8 soundbar with the TV and Xbox Series X. The Series X goes to a Black screen with no volume for 2 seconds often while gaming with Gaming Optimization On and Off. I've used Optical, Hi Speed HDMI as well as Bluetooth to connect it.

Overall it is an amazing television that I highly recommend if you can afford it.

We have experienced no burn-in with my Son playing games for up to 6 hours at a time or longer on Summer break.

We have about 4000 hours on the TV in these first 12 months and I still get excited watching it every time.",B08WG4HKKY,In person it's something else...,Size: 42 inchStyle: TV Only,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Amazon asked for delivery feedback. The form does not cover why I was not satisfied with the delivery of this TV. It seems to have survived although it was mishandled.

1 - It was not properly loaded on the truck, although it was secured so it would not fall over, it was standing on it's side, which every TV manufacturer says not to do. It was transported this way from a center 60- 70 miles from my residence rather than one that is only a few miles away.
2 - One person then carried it from the truck to my doorway basically upside down at a 45 degree angle. Although not really heavy it's a 2 person job to carry it properly.

This is an OLED which have an extremely thin screens. They should only be transported standing up like they are when they are setup in use. There are diagrams on the box showing this and is easily found using an internet search. At least it wasn't laying flat which is know to crack OLED screens. Somehow it survived and seems to be fine. Hopefully there isn't any hidden damage that will show up later.

The TV on the other hand is Amazing so far. It replaced a 10yr old Plasma. OLED is the only technology that can match or exceed the blacks, color and contrast levels of a Plasma. It definitely exceeds the picture quality of my 9 and 10 year old Plasma TVs. It's about 18lbs lighter and uses slightly more than 1/4 of the power. The only possible downfall for an OLED is possible image retention/burn-in which Plasmas also have. Neither of my Plasmas have any image retention or burn in still.

I did not rate the smart features as I will probably never use them and have disabled most by declining many of the Terms and Conditions not needed for basic TV operation.

I did not rate the gaming as it will not be used for gaming either.

I would really like to purchase the 65"" or 77"" version for the setup in my basement which now also has been upgraded to a Dolby Atmos/DTS:X 7.1.4 capable sound system using real components, however I am not sure I can trust the delivery service for it through Amazon now.",B08WG4HKKY,Good value for price,Size: 48 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Really good TV, great image, good sound. The refresh rates on this guy are really good, compared to many others out there. However, there are a few things that make this feel like a cheap TV. My cons below, are not deal breakers for me, but I'd of preferred a more seamless integration with Alexa.

If things look weird to you, like they did to me, turn off ""True motion"". I say weird, as you can't put your finger on it, but motion looks weird. It's like it's not quite going at the right speed or something.
Go to settings.
Select picture menu.
Click on picture mode settings and picture options.
Turn TrueMotion from smooth to off.

Cons:
*integrating it with like an Alexa Dot is far more difficult than it should be, and what functionality you get out of it seems to different every time I perform the steps. (details below)
1. Right now I can tell my Alexa to turn the TV Off, and turn the volume up and down, but other times I had done the integration steps these didn't work.
2. I can tell my Alexa to open Netflix
3. I can tell my Alexa to Pause/Resume Netflix (which pauses any streaming app), but she doesn't understand if I say pause amazon prime for example, so I pause and resume ""netflix"" no matter what app I'm using.
4. I can not turn my TV on with my Alexa Dot, even though I have the TV setting to stay partially awake when off to receive commands.
* The Remote control push to talk, leaves a lot to be desired, and very often requires you to use the remote to make a selection, or the options it presents disappear.
* The integrated Alexa with the remote also seems useless. I also have a bug where my audio cuts out, but hitting the remote's alexa button fixes it.",B08WG4HKKY,Worth it. Buy it if you can afford it.,Size: 77 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars

It does take some time to get used to the menu and how to find stuff, but overall once you get the audio and video fine-tuned to your particular taste, I challenge you to find warts with this set.

"Honestly the only problem I have with this tv was the delivery. Took an extra week and a half due to NSD’s incompetence.

This is a gorgeous tv with a pretty dynamic and pure range of colors. The blacks are pure as heck, some loading screens leave my room pitch black. The size is great for console gaming, not too much or too little so I recommend the 48 inch if this is going in your room or gaming room. It can work in a living room but depending on the size of the room I’d say this is the smallest you’d wanna go. It’s a size you really can’t go wrong with.

Only “issue” I have is trying to manage glare from window light but that’s not the fault of the tv. During the day, the clarity and sharpness of this thing still shines through regardless. At night, this tv looks incredible.

Truly you can’t find a better tv out there with the specs to handle high level console gaming. Great frame rate, great picture and sharpness, great colors, great blacks, HDR is here too.

"At 48"", this looks sharper than the 43"" 4K it replaced. I think it has something to do with the subpixels being individually lit making it appear even sharper than 4k to my eyes. I feel like it's bright enough in a darker room - Actually bright enough to make your eyes hurt sometimes. In a brightly lit room, I can see it being dim. Overall, it's really the contrast that makes this thing shine so as long as you can control the lighting in the room, you'll be amazed.

Gaming is perfect. I've got a 3080ti hooked up, and it's good for perfect video with G-Sync (*compatible - it does not have a hardware board... It's really using AMD's FreeSync, but it's been pretty seamless). Everything feels faster, maybe that's just moving from 60hz to 120hz or the faster response of the display, but it feels awesome.

Windows HDR actually works with this display - That was a huge surprise. And it works really well! Especially 'autoHDR', which is a XBox feature I believe, which basically 'fakes' HDR on games without it.

Using it as a display to do Excel or Word or anything like that is a BAD IDEA. I use it mostly to consume content and play games - what it's made for. Now, don't get me wrong, it works for that. But the auto-dimming features will annoy you & you risk burn in. If that's your primary use case, buy yourself a decent $150-200 27"" IPS display to use as a second monitor for that.

I've set it to my liking, but it turns out there's built in hardware to help calibrate the display! You do need a $160 calibrator and some software, but it's totally automated by connecting right to the TV over it's IP address.

And another welcome treat is software called ColorControl that's available on GitHub ( I believe it's open source ) that controls the TV so it'll turn off when the screensaver kicks in as well as sync turning it on and off to your PC's power state. It's really helpful when using this as a monitor.

It seems like C1's made later in the manufacturing cycle seem to be all WBE panels. I got one, there's a few websites that show how to check a number on the box to tell which panel is installed. I'm not sure what difference it really makes, I just know it looks great.

"I'm giving the tv 5 stars bc this tv is great for gaming and the picture quality is so good. Only a few little but not serious weaknesses. The biggest flaw is I'm not quite satisfied with the sound quality. When gaming I don't feel the sound is balanced well so I miss out on little suttle noises.

If you have a really bright living room and watch tv during the day you may want to go with the c2 or a Samsung bc this tv may not be bright enough. I have to turn the pixels up to like 80% and my room doesn't have a lot of light coming in. LG are not known for being bright.
And lastly now that I have an oled tv I find myself worrying about burn in over time but we will see. All flaws aside I can tell you this tv is the best I've ever owned and I'm always impressed with the picture quality. And it doesn't get much better for gamers hdr & dobly vision gaming at 120hz. Game optimizer menue, black frame insertion. This tv definitely built for gamers.

Update: decided to buy a soundbar for the first time in my life and for the price I'm paying you think LG would throw in better quality speakers or atleast sell the tv w soundbar as a bundle. I will not be getting an lg soundbar as I feel I've already paid them enough money

Update: after several months I continue to be impressed w the picture quality every time I turn it on. A word of caution. I don't think this tv is meant for a bright room. During the day I turn the pixels all the way up and theirs not a lot of sunlight coming through. I primarily use it for gaming. You can use dynamic tone mapping to brighten the screen , but you will lose some shadow detail. sometimes the blacks are over powering. So if your planning on gaming in a bright room you probably should get something else. I hear the Samsung oleds are a little brighter. Anyway I'm still very happy w my purchase inspite of the tvs weak points. Hope that helps, game on :)",B08WG4HKKY,Excellent TV,Size: 50-inch,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The picture and sound quality is truly amazing but the smart TV interface kc webOS is not intuitive, it’s cumbersome, and crashes frequently, to the point where it’s unusable.

"The LG C1 is a fantastic premium television that provides a wonderful picture, with deep, rich, precise colors and incredible gaming features. Honestly, you can look at any number of reviews for it online and they'll all largely say the same thing. I don't want to go down that well-travelled road.

My review will instead focus on the EVO panel lottery, which is going on behind the scenes at LG's assembly plants. What this means is that some C1s will have the new EVO panels, which are supposed to be brighter and last longer. In all actuality, you might not really notice it, especially since LG closed the loophole to ""change"" the C1 into an G1 via the service menu, meaning that the much ballyhooed ""hack"" is no longer viable.

So here are the facts:

1. LG C1s are being manufactured with WBC and WBE (EVO) panels. There's no way around it.

2. Just because you got a WBC panel does not mean your panel is bad, but it theoretically means it will not last as long as the WBE, which has more durability and can be driven harder by the SOC, which really is a moot point, since the C1 firmware loophole was closed. So that just leaves durability.

3. Given how ""all over the place"" brightness can be from panel to panel when it comes to the C1 series, you might actually get a WBC panel that is ""brighter"" than a WBE panel. It's called the panel lottery for a reason, and I've even seen CXs that are brighter than C1s and G1 (the latter of which has the EVO panel advertised).

4. Just because you have a recently manufactured LG C1 doesn't mean you have an EVO panel, so please ignore people on the internet telling you otherwise. They are wrong, wrong, wrong. There's a way you can tell if a unit has an EVO panel, and it involves looking at the box, or going into the service menu, which I don't recommend. I'm intentionally not going into detail, because the whole situation is just a bit ridiculous.

5. Please do not lose your mind and start returning and exchanging units in hopes of getting a WBE panel. It's silly and pointless, and you might wind up with panels that are inferior to the one you initially received.

If you want a guaranteed EVO panel that will run brighter, then buy a G1 or wait for the C2...it's that simple. Do I think it's worth it? No, I don't. But you do you.

If you're concerned about panel durability, therefore making the search for WBE worth it...my advice is to just buy an extended warranty.

"I have a Samsung QN82Q6FNA from a few years ago. It was the centerpiece of the house...heck...of the street. Well I bought this LG C1 77"" for my mother, and O MY GAWD! I'm embarrassed by my QLED now. It's not just that the C1 OLED blacks are true black. Every color on the screen is more vibrant, richer.

The smart hub on the C1 line (2021) is a significant upgrade over the smart menu on the CX and earlier models (2020). That said, these smart hubs are infuriating in that they always require you to click down past an ad block before you get to your own apps. Also, setting up your apps in the smart hub isn't quite as intuitive or easy as other hubs (granted, nothing is more simple than Roku).

The magic wand remote is either a love it or hate it thing. I hate it. The default setting when you bring up the TV's options menu is to use the remote as a gyro mouse. All it takes is one press of the directional button to put the remote back into button mode, but A) the jump into gyro mode is disorienting, and B) try explaining to your 70-year-old parent how to deal with this innovation, and then get back to me. Seriously, the gyro mouse serves zero function. It moves you away from the menu because it kicks-in and starts moving right away. If you don't click at exactly the right spot, the menu goes away. The only thing I'd ever voluntarily use it for is punching-in pass codes during the one-time initialization setup of apps.

I use the ARC (Audio Return Channel) feature a lot. This TV tries to outsmart itself by immediately going into TV audio if I manually turn off the receiver or swap inputs on the receiver. This is annoying, especially when the TV gets stuck on TV audio out even when the receiver is returned to the correct input.

These manufacturers really need to stop trying to out-think their consumers. I'm good with innovation, but CEC, for example, just isn't intuitive enough to be so draconian. Here's an example, I want to use the ARC function, but the only way to use ARC on most devices is to enable CEC. Well guess what? There are more subtle manipulations of a home theater, and more devices from more disparate manufacturers, than most TVs or AV receivers are capable of manipulating. But if all I want is ARC, then I have to live with the TV turning on my AV receiver but not knowing which input/output to set the receiver to, and it doesn't do anything to turn on my wireless speakers, etc.

The 5 stars is for the best picture quality you can get without going into the ridiculously high end home theater market (think Best Buy's Magnolia showroom where a single remote runs about $1,000, and only a professional has the security key to set it up).",B08WG4HKKY,TV great but unusable software,Size: 43-inch,4.0 out of 5 stars

"This is a nice, cheap TV that doesn’t require a cable box or cable subscription to watch plenty of content. It will help if you already have a subscription to a service like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime (which comes with Prime Video), Disney+, ESPN+, Paramount+, Peacock or anything else. But there is a good selection of free offerings as well. Pluto TV has lots of random free channels and just airs ads, like normal TV, and I've watched it quite a bit. There are other similar free services I haven’t tried, like Vudu (for movies), Crackle (TV and movies), and Xumo (movies and TV) that should work. And then you always have access to everything on YouTube.

But if you are not using traditional cable service, then this TV is only going to be as good as the internet connection you provide, since all this content is streamed. You can connect it to wifi, but this TV has an ethernet port, so I plugged a line directly from my modem to the TV, which gives me a stable connection and nice picture quality. When I tried to use wifi, I did get buffering, so unless you have pretty good wifi speeds, use an ethernet cable.

The sound quality is good, and there are the necessary ports if you wanted to add a sound bar or some other audio device. Picture quality is decent enough as well. This is not a pristine HD TV, but you should've expected that from the price. My TV arrived with one dead pixel toward the top of the screen, but for me that wasn’t a deal breaker.

As far as usability, if you already own an Android phone then you’re probably familiar with how everything works. This is basically a modified version of the Android operating system designed for a TV. To get apps, whether it’s Netflix or Pluto TV, you go to the Google app store and download them there. Any app you can download and use with your phone to watch stuff will probably be available for this TV. If you aren't good with modern technology and smart phones, you may struggle to use this TV - I've been an Android phone user for years.

The remote is a minimalistic design, so there are no dedicated rewind/FF buttons or “back” buttons, etc. Like you would with your cell phone, you just intuitively figure out whether the back arrow will rewind when you’re in a show or take you back when you’re in a menu, etc. (I saw someone in another review complain that the TV didn’t come with a remote - mine came with a remote, two new batteries, a power cable, and an A/V adapter cable.) Again, some people who aren't used to modern user interfaces for phone apps and that sort of thing might find the remote confusing at times.

Overall, I think this is a useful TV for less than $200. For the room I wanted to put this TV in, the monthly cost for another box from my cable company would’ve been exorbitant.

"Like most other reviewers, I noticed a horrible lag between pressing a button and seeing a response on the screen. My other two smart TVs don't have that problem, so it isn't anything to do with the Wi-Fi. The quick setup went so smoothly that I was excited that this would be a terrific smart device, but then everything fell apart from there. The developers clearly have not perfected or even made an acceptable user interface. The devs need to watch ordinary people try to use their hot mess.

Adding a second account was like transporting back to the 1990s because it didn't even offer something like the smart setup (or a QR code) to help speed things along. The lagginess was comically horrific when trying to use the remote to enter my second account email address. Once logged in, the user experience was confusing, awkwardnessful, and annoying. It needs to offer up the option to make the narration lady be silent. She announces every menu you click past and every key you type, including your password characters! STAY AWAY.

Anyone with a background in user interface design would know to integrate timely and helpful tutorials to learn the features of the TV.

Also, this was supposed to be a brand new device, but it clearly had been previously used --- probably by someone else who decided to return it because of the bad user experience. There was also something rattling around in the TV case.

If you decide to purchase, you will need one of those 90 degree adapters to hook up a broadcast TV antenna. That's just another painful thing about this device.

My box had been retaped and didn't contain any documentation. I don't know it that's intentional, but MINIMALLY there should be a packing list (saying what parts are supposed to be in the box). If no printed manual is to be provided, a URL or QR code is needed to be packed in or on the shipping box to provide a hyperlink to a owners manual.

After trying this TV for about an hour, I knew I would be returning it to Amazon. As I wrote this review, the obnoxious narration lady's voice (who says something everytime you do ANYTHING with the remote, and who says things during YouTube playback, and who says things even when you are not using the TV, so good luck falling asleep) announced that the TV was about to run out of storage. What?!? I had used it only an hour WITHOUT WATCHING ANYTHING aside from one five-minute YouTube video, and I had already removed my accounts, so why the heck would it be running out of storage?!? Is troubleshooting that problem something you want to deal with on your first day of owning a brand new tv?

The picture quality is acceptable when viewed directly in front of the screen but quickly degrades when viewed from an angle. The two photos of a paused screen show the difference. The angle photo was taken at approximately 45 degrees. As soon as you shift your viewing position from dead center the blacks begin to fade and the picture gets washed out with a florescent light greenish white tint. I've never seen a TV that was this sensitive to viewing angle. The speakers are fine at low volume but not so good at medium and louder volumes.

"Replaced my 65"" OLED B7a from 2017 with a 77"" C2 and I've been running it for a week as of now. The picture quality after calibration has improved over the older model. I feel the black levels on this device are far far better than the B7a ever were, which BTW required a lot of ""tinkering"" to get to what the C2 did pretty much out of the box. My old OLED had no burn-in that I could see, even after 5 years of daily usage, but the older OLED panel was never as uniform in solid colors test as this panel is, not even when the B7a was new. Especially watching dark scenes now, there is no fixed pattern noise anymore.

The scene motion on this TV is better what the B7a has, which was already good, but it had issues with some stuttering under certain conditions. Obviously this TV is 120hz with a 5 year newer video processing unit, so it would be expected to be a good improvement.

The worst part for me during initial setup was figuring out the new WebOS UI. Coming from the older B7a WebOS, which had things in different places and required different steps to get things done was quite frustrating at first. I guess once you understand how it works its okay.

After setting the TV like I wanted, I then updated the firmware and after the firmware update things didn't work right, things like LG channels got stuck, couldn't click out of some popups, etc, so I had to perform a factory reset, and redo the whole setup again. The TV has been running well since. So be aware that if you perform a hardware reset, chances are you might have to do a factory reset and redo all the settings.

The remote internal accelerometer wasn't calibrated somehow when I first paired it, so the pointer kept always pulling to the left on the screen. To resolve this I had to shake the remote several times until it finally became accurate. The scroll wheel feels a bit too deep this time compared to the previous magic remote from the B7a, which was way too high... guess the next TV will be at the sweet spot! :)

IMO. For the price of this TV I would've liked some backlight on the remote too. I did miss not having a pause button on the remote like the B7a. Which was nice to pause shows without having to bring the menu and click on the pause screen button.

Connectivity for DLNA worked well, the NAS and other storage stuff in my LAN was detected fine after everything was setup correctly.

Mobile screen cast via Miracast, etc... worked well with all my phones/tablets that are capable of screen cast.

All the basic streaming services I've tried worked well too.

Audio from the default speakers is certainly okay for a TV, and it seems to have improved the spatial audio somehow over the older B7a. Still no match for a dedicated receiver/speakers setup, but if you don't have one, this TV alone will be a good start.

Privacy was and is still a concern for me with this TV. And let me say it loud and clear: Serving ads on a 2500 dollar TV feels quite a bit of an insult, TBF; b/c at that point why not just give the TV away for free? if you are going to soak the end user in ads, and sell their usage stats, etc at some good $$$?
I believe most of the tracking, etc can be disabled by going into the agreements and disabling all the options there. For most of the basic B7a level of functionality that I wanted I only had to agree with the two first terms, so voice and all other terms are not enabled, which still is a bit of a concern to trust if a company will honor a checkbox... Also, the remote seems to have a built-in microphone, so if you are super concerned about this thing eavesdropping then you can just take the batteries out of the remote, or use an universal remote but you lose the nice mouse-like pointer. The old B7a remote doesn't seem to offer full functionality with the C2, at least not the mouse pointer part.

Overall the TV was a step up from the B7a, both in size and picture quality. Only time will tell how the TV pans out in the end, but if the B7a was an indication, working well for 5 years, I think this TV should last at least the same amount of time.",B09RMRNSBF,This TV HATES Hulu-Live!!!,Size: 32 inches,4.0 out of 5 stars
"First week impression: visually stunning with some annoying quirks as a computer monitor.

I purchased this to replace an aging Seiki SM40UNP. I use it exclusively as a computer monitor, both for work and gaming. Visually the LG is in a different league than the Seiki. Colors are more vivid, it's much brighter, and blacks are like a portal to the endless void. These differences were apparent before enabling HDR, and then HDR bumped up the colors and brightness even further. During HDR calibration I flinched and cursed to an empty room when it switched from black to white; it was blinding. For gaming this is good stuff. I played some games with native HDR and some games with Windows Auto HDR. I ended up disabling Auto HDR because I thought it made some games look over-saturated, but that's probably just personal preference. Native HDR looks great.

The same visual fidelity that's great for games is a little overwhelming when using the monitor as a workstation, particularly when reading black text on a white background. Even after cranking the SDR brightness in Windows down to its lowest level, I can feel eye strain starting after just an hour of reading text. Some people have suggested that this has more to do with Windows' HDR implementation than the monitor itself; I don't know. Whatever the cause, I prefer the drab presentation of the Seiki monitor for reading/editing text. I'm typing this review on an old LCD monitor because it's more comfortable than doing it on the LG.

OLED protection features are also a bit annoying at times. E.g. if the TV detects that the input it's showing is mostly unchanging, it will slowly dim the screen. Unfortunately, typing into a dark-themed text editor seems to count as ""mostly unchanging"". Every 10 minutes or so I need to grab a bright window and shake it to wake the monitor from its apparent stupor. It's like trying to keep a tired puppy awake. I disabled other features like logo dimming that seemed to be causing problems, so this whole-screen dimming is the only one that continues to irk me. I also voluntarily use a black wallpaper and configure the Windows taskbar to auto-hide to protect the panel from burn-in; make sure you know what you're getting into if you're going OLED for the first time.

The most significant weakness of this TV is that it is... well, a TV. It's a bad sign when you have to use a remote control to agree to a privacy policy before using a computer monitor. It's not plug-and-play, it's plug-and-read-reddit-thread-and-modify-dozens-of-settings-and-play. After spending a couple hours researching and fiddling with settings there are still some things I'm not happy with. For instance, the TV doesn't enter standby the way purpose-built computer monitors do. When the computer stops sending a signal the TV takes over and shows vibrant wallpapers for a while before turning off completely, such that you have to turn on the TV again separately from waking up the computer. Maybe there's a setting to change this - if there is, I may never find it.

The final quirk is a graininess most noticeable in uniform blocks of grayish colors, which unfortunately feature prominently in many dark-themed applications. It appears to be caused by slight variation in pixel color. The grain is visible at a viewing distance of 24 inches / 60 cm, but IMO it's only distracting if you're closer than 18 inches / 45 cm.",B09RMRNSBF,Great Picture,Size: 65-InchStyle: TV Only,4.0 out of 5 stars
"This 77” LG C2 OLED TV is absolutely breathtaking. This is the best picture quality I’ve personally ever seen and it actually exceeded my expectations. Of course you get stunning contrast, colors, and crisp 4K scenes, but I want to call out some lesser mentioned features that I’ve already come to love.

- Magic remote: the Nintendo WII style cursor that allows you to navigate all apps either through traditional remote buttons or via the aim and click method is great - providing a new way of doing things but allowing you to still use traditional buttons. Also allows for equipment control to control my Samsung sound bar.
- WebOS: unlike my older LG tv, now all my streaming apps are native to tv. I get to ditch the Fire tv cube for paramount plus and HBO max
- Alexa integration works nicely
- Game mode, presets like FPS, RPG etc make switching for each game super easy. Already this tv has given an upper edge in FPS games.
- Sound- for some reason all sound is crisper
- Airplay: iOS screen mirroring and airplay work great, as well as screen mirroring from my MacBook Pro. I didn’t realize this was a feature.

Only downside so far is the Picture in Picture / split screen not working (seen other reviewers having same experience). It would be great to be able to play a game and have Netflix in a PIP window. Hopefully future software updates will fix this.",B09RMRNSBF,"Big step up from the OLED B7a, but the whole ads and data collection is concerning.",Size: 75-InchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Where to start? Beautiful picture 4k and SD, outstanding sound, well thought out design. It's all that and more. However, a diagram of the inputs and outputs would be REAL handy, especially when trying to plug things in, And just what do you do with the little plastic pieces (finally found in the one page instruction sheet). And the same goes for the, what I assume to be, IR blasters? Since it is set up for the PC that gloriously melted down when I attached it to the monitor (I should point out that the Alienware died while the Pi 4 8GB and little NUC never had a problem with it), I can not say how it looks for gaming and will be moving it and taking photos of the port connections and label them in the photo for future reference. I also found it to be a royal pain to find anything on LG's website. I still haven't registered it because my model does not exist yet. I hate time paradoxes! Okay, fine let's look for any manuals. Oh. I see. searching support gives an article Google Stadia issues, and another that tries to sell me one. Not holding out hopes for any support, at least for a while. It really makes me wonder if the fire sale pricing is a way to get rid of stock...

In short, don't buy unless you are techy, geeky, or know someone who is, and treat then we because they will be your support for this beautiful monitor. I know I am ripping on it, but as I said earlier, it has a beautiful picture, outstanding sound, well thought out design (if they only documented it better).

"#1 son installed the TV following the directions provided, connecting the cable and Blu-ray player was simple. One remote included. Cable remotes can turn set on or off but can’t move through the menu, need the Lg remote for that and signing into apps.

I watch NHL, MLB and NFL games with no picture problems. I don’t play video games. Have dozens of DVDs, some old, and so far no problem playing them using it’s remote. Great bright picture from any angle, some older TV shows & movies automatically show in old formats that don’t fill the screen. Internet ready, but it has an app for the ones I use and no info on what else I could do with it.

This TV, like so many devices now, does not come with even a basic instruction booklet on how to use all the features, so stumbling your way around is required to set up your Disney+ or Netflix, or what the unmarked colored buttons are for, etc. For all I know it may cook my dinner but I’ll never find that feature!

I would love to tell you that this tv is great. It looks awesome at the Best Buy that i saw it at. But I will continue to have to wait to get my hands on this tv. Their attempt to deliver this tv failed on epic proportions. My wife and I were here waiting all day for this tv. I left my phone in the bedroom while I took a quick shower. They called my phone while I was in the shower and did not bother to knock on the door. They said no one was home and rescheduled the delivery. I called the number back 4 minutes after they called; for them to tell me there was no way to get a hold of the driver and I would have to reschedule. The delivery truck comes from somewhere in Houston TX and I live in college station tx which about 2-2.5 hours depending on traffic. They were in my drive way and because I didn’t answer my phone they are going to reschedule a delivery that it over a hundred miles away simply because they did not knock on the door. I do not see how any of this makes sense. However the tv is amazing. I love it the best tv I’ve ever watched or game on.,B09RMRNSBF,Blown away,Size: 32-InchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars

"Coming from a Acer Predator 34 inch curved monitor, the size increase of this monitor isn't a shock. The width is similar, but there is more vertical height for sure. I will say that for a monitor sitting on a desk, 42 inches is about the limit for me. Any larger and you are turning your head too much.

I also recommend a monitor arm so you can move this around easily. So often in the past I have done without it and once you get an arm, you wont want to deal with something sitting on your desk. Especially a 42 inch monitor or tv.

It's a great OLED display with plenty of brightness. It supports G-Sync / FreeSync and variable refresh rate (VRR) @ 120hz. It has inky blacks as all good OLED screens do. The auto white balance is not too annoying for PC use in my opinion.

Since its a 4k screen, I do organize windows in all 4 corners of the display for work and I am sure that we will see a small amount of image retention eventually. Time will tell. I haven't turned off any of the self protecting features of the TV and don't plan to. Nothing annoying to report as a result. There is also a pixel cleaning feature that runs as needed already if this works similar to C1 models.

It really is one of the best displays I have ever used both in terms of color, black levels, response time, and clarity.

"8/14/22 update: LG got the parts out fairly quickly and a local electronics company did the repair in less than an hour. They replaced the screen, not a board.

I reiterate that the TV itself is a 5 — it’s got a fantastic picture and I have 30+ years of broadcast TV production experience so I know what I’m talking about.

But I’m only updating my rating to 4/5 instead of 5/5 because of LG’s service process.

When I opened the original repair ticket, LG automatically provided troubleshooting recommendations. I had already followed the instructions that are available online and told them so. However, there’s no ability to attach a picture to the ticket and they automatically close the original ticket and then ask you to open a new ticket with all of the same information that was provided previously in case troubleshooting doesn’t fix the problem.

Once the second ticket was entered LG eventually asked for a picture but then they didn’t make it available to the repair facility so they asked for a picture as well.

Start to finish, time to repair completion was about a week and the TV was not completely down during this time. But I think LG’s repair ticket workflow needs some tweaks

Would have rated this 5 stars as it's a fantastic TV but yesterday a thin line developed top to bottom about 1/3 of the way in from the right edge.

"This is my second LG and third led flat screen. The screen here is incredibly thin (at least at the top) and the whole unit was much lighter than my previous 65 inch. That made it easy to mount by myself. The picture is beautiful and because I have shades on all the windows of my TV room the brightness is more than adequate (knew OLEDs can have a brightness problem but this model--and the next higher--have been reviewed as quite good in the brightness area.) Because I had an LG previously, I am quite familiar with the controls and the options although the OS in much updated from my previous unit, but that is part of why I bought new. Now I can do any and all streaming directly from the TV without needing to go through my cable service and/or a Fire cube as I was doing. It is also very convenient that the TV controls the on/off of the new AV receiver I also just bought (down to only two remotes!). The only difficulty I had in getting everything setup was to get the lip sync correct which ended up requiring that I bypass any corrections from both the TV and Receiver.

"Bought to use as a pc monitor; general email, excel, PowerPoint, and teams work.

Setup was easy, 2 screws each to attach the legs and it was standing up. The body is pretty thin and flexes, but under 2 bills it’s forgivable.

Turned it on and there’s no way to bypass smart features and signed onto Amazon with wifi and all. Needed to update so gave it a few min.

The remote has no input button so have to navigate via the fire home screen which is pretty annoying. After first use, there’s a stacked panes button remote that’s for recent favorites and does in a way act as an input button. Tv doesn’t remember which input you leave on and boots to fire Home Screen every time. Couple more button presses in the morning I guess.

Screen is more than bright enough for desk work, I actually turned down brightness as I’m sitting about 2.5 ft away. Tv doesn’t do 4:4:4 chroma so text is not perfect but perfectly serviceable after a few tweaks; setting picture mode to pc and turning on super resolution seems to do the trick for now. Most general office work has black text against white in excel, outlook, teams, etc. don’t expect it to give me trouble reading wise but am aware it wouldn’t be the best monitor for detailed graphics nor critical PowerPoint where accurate colors are required. Attaching pictures of general office work and rtings chroma test: most are perfectly legible except the lowest two rows where there is some blur but legible, I don’t expect to read text in those color schemes for general office work.

A few surprises, this is actually natively airplay compatible and HomeKit. Airplay is always nice to have for a quick screen share from phone and HomeKit integration means I have a spare remote on my phone and it helps with the input button annoyance.

There is a slight window pane effect sitting this close, the utmost outer edge where the scroll bar would sit for many applications has an odd 3D effect, like it’s floating. Looks a little funny but not a show stopper.

Love the screen productivity this affords, it’s literally 4 x 21.5” at 1080p each, and with quick windows shortcuts (win+left+up, etc) it’s really easy to snap windows into a 4 grid to multitask or cross reference data.

Or it can offer massive screen real estate for spreadsheets and multiple word pages.

Now let’s hope it lasts.

Update***
While screen sharpness and text was not an issue, after a full day of work decided to return, the input lag was disruptive. Would have been fine for general home theater pc use but the typing lag was not conducive for work where I’m constantly firing off emails and messages.

"I use it for computer monitor, and the text is very sharp. You have an option of changing the type to PC.
I also use the computer to calibrate the text.
Other than that, some very minor negative:

1. It updates twice, meaning it can't get the latest and update. This is very minor.
2. It shows 4k youtube video in very good pictures, however, on some other video, the color is a bit off. It is very similar to when I compare Samsung $900 TV with $1700 TV. For $200 level monitor, it's a great deal.
3. The edges, when viewing close as a monitor, it reflects into the screen, and actually override the screen's edge, such as the scrollbar. This is a bit bigger issue. However, for $200 and very clear text, I would buy it again. Actually, I did, I bought one for my wife, then get another for myself.
4. The size is about perfect for monitor. The one it replaces is 48"", and I find myself having to move a bit left and right. When they make it curved (at low price), 48"" is probably fine.
5. This is not for game, at 4k, it works at 30 framerate, probably due to my computer, not the monitor, but it appears to support up to 60 frame per seconds. Still not for game, but not bad at all.

6. It has problem display some text not clearly, as black text in pink background, as seen in the attached picture. It is rare for many people to have this combination, but it's a minor problem anyway.

-The built in smart stuff is probably fine for most people, but I prefer Apple TV.

-Because I don't use the built in smart stuff, it complains every time I turn it on that it's not connected to Wifi or Amazon. I use HDMI-CEC to control it through the Apple TV though, so I only see this message for a few seconds before it switches over. Annoying, but that's it.

"I was definitely hesitant given the reviews, but so far so good with one minor hiccup. I can't seem to get it to recognize my PC via HDMI. The PC recognizes the TV, the TV recognizes that something is plugged in, but it says no signal detected no matter what I've tried. Restarts, resets, plugging and unplugging, different cords, etc. I feel like I might be missing something simple.

That is not a dealbreaker, however, because it functions surprisingly well as a Smart TV. It's quick, no major delays or funkiness. Huge huge upgrade from the smart tvs of yesteryear, if that's holding anyone back. I've seen a lot of people complain about the ads, but they're confined to the home menu. You're not getting ads during Netflix or anything.

Overall I'm pretty pleased with this purchase, having paid about $250 out the door. I don't really need another computer monitor, so purely calling this a TV, it seems great, but longevity will be the true test.

Edit: Fixed the issue by setting the HDMI to 1.4 instead of 2.0 and it started working, but glitchy. Looks like it was a combination of that setting and a right-angle adapter I had on the pc end of the cable. Having changed those two things, it's now being used with my PC as well.",B08X7K3H7K,Great TV,Size: 65 in,5.0 out of 5 stars

"I found this during Prime Day, and got a hecka killer price. I wanted a Samsung, but alas its hard to find a 55"" Samsung model with all the features at a price I wanted.

I love the multiple HDMI hookups. You do not need a Firestick, so the one I have for my last TV is being used to hold papers down on my desk. The assembly was quick and easy. I am a senior and live alone so I was a bit worried that I might not be able to maneuver this out of the box and onto my TV stand, but I managed just fine. If you do unpack it alone, the easiest and safest thing to do is slide it out of the box onto your bed, hook up the legs [or stand if you go that direction], and hook up the power cord BEFORE you pick it up and put it down on the stand.

Wifi connection was a breeze, and the interface is just like the Firestick so its pretty easy to use and familiar to a veteran Firestick customer. Antenna driven TV was simple enough to add too, but I need to figure out if I can log into my Samsung account to get the on-air Samsung TV stuff.

I went through ALL the setting to try and change it. This is not in the display or sleep settings.

"Overall very happy with purchase.

Picture frame mode: looks fantastic, especially after adding a Samsung frame (purchased separately and shown in the pictures.) Paintings look absolutely real even up close. The brush strokes are so real looking! My only complaint is that the backlighting doesn’t adjust automatically based on the room lighting like it does when in TV mode. So as the sun sets the picture starts to look back lit giving away the illusion. It is possible to lower the backlighting with the remote to fix that, but it has to be done manually. Then the next day it’s too dark until you adjust it back up again. Would be perfect if it auto adjusted like it does in tv mode, but it doesn’t. Note that tv mode lighting is completely separate from frame mode lighting, which is good because the frame needs to be lower brightness when in frame mode to look like a real painting.

Tv mode: the picture quality with 4K looks better than my older Samsung 4K tv. Because of the matte finish there is zero glare where it had some glare on my old tv in the same spot. The Samsung software is harder to use than on my old Samsung tv but manageable. Some settings are difficult to find, and if a cable gets unplugged, you have to re-teach it what you have. It seems to lose settings easy when things get unplugged and doesn’t find them automatically again as my other Samsung tv does.

White Solar remote: so the solar feature simply does not work. Even leaving it in full sun for several hours makes no difference. Many other folks report this problem too. Thankfully you can charge it with a usb c connector (not provided) if you have one. I am able to get the remote to control my tv, surround sound via Denon receiver, my Xfinity cable box and my AppleTV device. So it’s great to be using one remote for everything. However, because the remote has so few buttons, it can take a series of 5 or 6 presses to get to certain menus on my cable box dvr (like to see my recorded shows). It’s doable but difficult. There just isn’t a good simple option for quickly getting to some cable tv menus.

Overall a great product if not a bit on the expensive side. If you can live with the software flaws, you will be happy with the end result. Who knows, perhaps a software update in the future could make them better. I still recommend this TV.",B09VCVGH7B,Best Buy,Size: 43 inches,4.0 out of 5 stars
"We bought this product because it could look like a frame flush with the wall, and we could hide all the wires behind it. The mount comes with 2 mounting plates 12 inch width each. The instructions only support drilling into studs, but the plates can't cover 2 studs spaced 16 inch apart . We wanted to mount in a location where both plates fell in between the studs, and had no option to secure them to the wall. I had to open the wall to install reinforcement. It would be nice if it came with one long mounting plate, like other mounting systems. The one connect box is bulky, it needs to have a big recess behind the tv to hide it. I'm still giving it 4 because the final result is awesome, and the tv is amazing.",B09VCVGH7B,perfect for my bedroom,Size: 32 inches,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Overall, this is an impressive device and I'm happy with my purchase.

The anti-reflective coating is truly unique among all screens I've ever seen, and this was my major reason for purchasing it. I can have all the lights on in the room with bright, direct sun coming through big windows. There won't be a single reflection anywhere on the screen. I've never seen a screen do anything like this.

The result is that art (especially paintings) look like they're on a canvas. Several guests have not been able to tell it was a TV when in art mode. High-resolution photographs on the other hand look almost ""hyper-real"", because no canvas print could ever match the resolution achieved on the screen. The result is always beautiful.

The viewing experience as a TV is also comfortable and enjoyable *during* the viewing.

My major complaint is that the software is clunky. It is a slow process to upload images to the TV. It took a while to figure out how to crop images correctly (as 16:9) to remove the mat, and there was no help for this in the app. The TV itself supports all the usual apps, and so the experience within the apps is reasonable, but the navigation between them is clunky as well. You also can't seem to use pure voice control (via Bixby) unless you also buy a *Samsung* soundbar!

The good news is that you spend most of your time watching the TV or viewing art rather than using the interface, so in practice, it's just an annoyance. Still, it's frustrating that Samsung hasn't paid more attention to the user interface experience, and if they ever do with an update, I'll be changing this to 5 stars.",B09VCVGH7B,Great as a picture frame and as a TV with a few cons,Size: 43 inches,4.0 out of 5 stars
"The picture is excellent. The wall mount is amazing. The art display mode is great. The sound is surprisingly good. The compatibility with PC / Apple products is great, including screen share from PC and airplay from the phone.

The auto-on/off needs to be better. After using this a couple of weeks, I still don't know how the WiFi on-off works, my guess is that it is tracking the smartthings app on my phone, but my phone is normally in lock mode, so it doesn't get the signal and thus turns the screen off (this even seems to happen right after I push the power button to turn it on ... it just turns off again right away). This is pretty annoying. It would be much better to have a motion sensor in the TV that just turned after some time of no motion. So, I ended up just turning this feature off and using the basic timeouts.

The art content is pretty limited. If they had screens like microsoft login screens, it would be really worth it. There are a few famous paintings, but most of the art is of the same style, which is not to my taste. So, I use mostly my own pictures / art. Annoyingly, they put your favorites and personal imported art all the way at the bottom, so you have to scroll through all the other stuff to get to what you want.

The upload options are pretty limited and not very good. It seems to auto-widen any picture you have to the full width. So, to work around this, you have to put them in photoshop and make a fake picture the size of the screen to get it to show up correctly on the Frame. They only have two options for the mat, unlike the options with the purchased art. Last, it seems to only allow one group for your own art / pictures. It would be much better to have multiple lists so you have different types of art depending on your mood (e.g. a beach theme, an impressionist theme, etc).

I would definitely buy this, but these improvements would make it much better.

"We have had the same TV for over 10 years, so I was very excited to finally upgrade to a nicer set. Our old set was Samsung and we've loved it, so I decided to stick with the brand. Did some research and discovered The Frame series, a concept I loved immediately! A TV that doesn't look like a TV, hanging on your wall and displaying great works of art? And the new 2022 matte screen? Sold! Sure, it was quite a bit more expensive than many other 65"" 4K TVs out there, but I loved the idea behind it so I ordered one.

All was great until I watched Last of the Mohicans. Any dark scenes (of which there are many) showed several cloudy white spots on the screen. Not very bright but instantly noticeable. I tried watching other movies and other sources to make sure the issue remained, and it did. Showed up just the same in the intro to Jurassic Park. Changed settings on the picture to make sure it wasn't a setting issue, still had the problem. The cloudy white patches are randomly placed, too, and do not move.

So, I ordered a replacement TV. New TV came, and guess what? Same issue, and this time there were more white spots and in different areas. Again, reconfirmed with multiple sources, shut off all lights in the room to make sure it wasn't a reflection issue, but sure enough, they are there and I can't get rid of them.

Now I wonder how wide spread the issue is and if Samsung is aware? Returning a massive TV like this is a hassle, I don't really want to try again through Amazon since I've had the same result twice. Anyone else notice this? I guess next step is to contact Samsung customer service. Will update if there is a solution.",B09VCVGH7B,Pretty TV,Size: 43 inches,3.0 out of 5 stars

"I genuinely enjoy this TV, and even in a world where you can get 120hz 4K sets for half this price, I was happy with my purchase—no buyer’s remorse (unlike the hard to swallow feeling of paying $100+ for the flimsy plastic bezel accessory which should be included for free).

The matte screen is simply a joy to the eye. Glare is virtually nonexistent. Fill your room with beautiful natural daylight, and you still get to enjoy gaming and viewing. You don’t have to compromise your room for the sake of the TV or vice versa. You don’t need a man cave.

I avoid smart TVs in general because they’re just not smart enough to be worth the hassle. The OS is usually slow, and the menus are clunky and unintuitive. This is no exception. I still would have given it a 5-star rating. That’s how much better this panel is—it improves your quality of life. Go ahead, enjoy Underworld at 19:00 instead of having to wait until the sun goes down.

The 2-star rating is for the awful tape residue/stain left by the utterly useless pieces of tape placed directly on the panel. When you unbox the TV, there will be the standard bezel wrap, which includes the Energy Star label. Unfortunately there is a larger type of tape that seems to be holding and protecting nothing at all. The adhesive from this tape seems to penetrate or bond to the screen and leave a stain that is visibly distracting whenever it is dark or off.

The official Samsung support answer is to wipe it away with distilled water and a soft microfiber. I assume this is to avoid damaging the screen with added minerals or harsh textures. Got my 500 gsm microfiber from The Rag Company, basically the softest and best, and I ordered some distilled water. No change. Now maybe I’m a noob who should just buy some screen cleaner, but I’m not risking my $1400+ investment to some unknown formula, especially when the manufacturer carries my warranty and did not authorize it. I refuse to be responsible for correcting an issue right out of the box.

I didn’t even 1-star it because I would honestly take this defect over a flawless standard TV. I fully expect matte screens to replace the glossy mirrors we used to call televisions. Yes monitors exist, but the larger sizes are more common for commercial or gaming applications and cost much more per inch. This is where it’s at. The manufacturers just need to avoid whatever tape is being placed on the panel.

Amazon was kind enough to send me a replacement, and it had the same tape and stain. Sending it back. Not an isolated incident. Sad because I just can’t go back to gloss now.

I love the bezel (very narrow), the anti-glare LOOKS like it should work great (we have a lot of huge windows in our room, so that was key). it's very thin, seems well made, great custom frame finishes, was well packaged, came fairly quickly, and wasn't too pricey. So - what's not to like ? Well, the whole idea behind paying the extra coin for this model is so that it'll look clean (like a picture on the wall) - yes ? Unfortunately, whoever designed the OneConnect module clearly never used the set. You CANNOT put it inside the wall, either behind or below the panel (it has needed connection ports on 2 perpendicular faces of the box - WHO is the i-dot who thought that could work ? It only comes with a short connection cable even if you DO decide to mount it externally outside the wall (and then it looks dopey since it is ungainly, and VERY poorly thought out needing cables to exit ifrom two perpendicular sides - insane). Want a longer connect cable ? No problem - just pay a ton more for an aftermarket version :-( We hired the top professional in Denver to attempt to dress it all up and make it work. He came over, listened to what we wanted thinking it'd be no problem...looked at what was here...thought and played around for a while...then promptly refunded all of our $ (even the trip charge) telling us that - in his opinion - no matter what he could think of, it was never going to look ""clean"" :-( Another trifling item - WHO is the clown who thought that a storm-trooper white remote control was a good design idea (for something which folks routinely need to pickup and manipulate with their hands) ? Just a gross, fingerprint-showing nightmare to constantly be cleaning, and yet another example of this product NOT having been tested even a little by folks who actually USED it :-o Add in the fact that you can see the electrostatic emitter behind the screen due to the charge massively grabbing dust out of the air around the set (despite having 2 brand new air filters which we installed to scrub the air in an effort to eliminate that issue), as well as the problems referenced in other reviews with displaying your own pics and Samsung trying to make extra bucks selling you online art; and you have just a recipe for a very vexing, disappointing product :-( We WANTED so badly to really like this - it just seems strongly like it wasnt' really ever tested by anyone who actually USED the product for more than an hour or two or in their own home. Overall, I'd have to say - it isn't the WORST...but wait another generation or two until Samsung (who is normally awesome) to actually issue a product with the kinks worked out that is ready for consumer use. As it is - it's WAY better in a store setting than anything you'll actually put onto your wall at home. Just my thoughts - but I did waste a ton of effort and time trying to make it work :-o",B09VCVGH7B,LOVE IT!!!,Size: 32-inchStyle: HD,4.0 out of 5 stars

"1) You can't upload photos wirelessly without going through the online server... Which is down frequently... I mean, a lot... So, if you want to do that last min surprise pic for your family at the TV, good luck
2) Regular pics (even high resolution) need some sort of treatment to look like the pics on the screen you might have seen in the shop... Samsung offers no tool to support you to make it sharp... The number of proper pics available without purchase is ridiculous... IT'S A $2K TV!!!
3) Some TVs come with bezel, some not... For the same price... Guess which I bought because I did not read the fine print last month?
4) Smart features such as movement sensor are not clearly explained... Yet to figure how that works
5) The tv mount is good. But does not come ready for drywalls and is not written anywhere until you open the box... You learn you need to buy drywall anchors after you open the box",B09VCVGH7B,Not even CLOSE to ready for prime-time...you really WANT it to work but...it doesn't :-(,Size: 32-inchStyle: HD,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Just wanted to write a quick review to quell the fears of the first 1 star review about them getting the wrong model. I got my Amazon delivery today (April 19th) ordered on April 16th and its the correct 55"" 2020 model with a matte display.

So far the display is pretty cool in art mode but literally just got it out of the box so can't say much more about it. Need to see it mounted properly and in different lighting conditions before I give my final thoughts.",B09VCVGH7B,Love the idea of art,Size: 32-inchStyle: HD,5.0 out of 5 stars

If any of the review horror stories come true, I will simply purchase a new TV. I do not deal with customer service people, ever.

"I love the TV, but the remote is pretty wimpy. It’s the same remote (or similar to) the remote we use in the bedroom for the Roku connected to a Panasonic Plasma screen that’s over fifteen years old. Television is perfect. The remote, not so much. It’ll pass, but we’ll probably add a universal remote to replace it and add it to our arsenal. That cost will be added to the overall cost of this television and it’s less than par remote. We’ll remember this and will know better when we begin looking for televisions to replace the older one in the bedroom. We’re also disappointed that there’s no other way to introduce audio to our home theatre system without purchasing a third party piece of equipment that will change the digital audio output to RCA inputs. I know it seems like older technology, but the television doesn’t even provide any Bluetooth capabilities to use a third party device we already have. We will absolutely do more research when it’s time to upgrade the plasma screen in the bedroom. We'll have a similar issue there.

Update: We chose to purchase a Roku Voice Remote that works great with our new television. We’d prefer using a keypad, but this works. We’ll probably still go a different route when we replace the plasma screen in the bedroom.

Update: We woke up one morning and the televise wouldn’t display a picture. We contacted the vendor and they said someone local would come to my house to see what the problem was. Nine days later, a local television repair company showed up. He and his “helper” proceeded to take the circuit board off my television then scratch up the front screen stating the board was bad and the television was no longer operable. I asked what I was supposed to do with the non-working television and he said I’d have to dispose of it myself. I asked about the $469 I had paid for the television six months ago and he said that Hisense would be reaching out to me within 24 hours. Three days later, Hisense called and said they’d be sending me a refund and I should expect a check in the mail in 10-14 days. I asked about them just sending me a replacement set and they told me that this would not be an option. I even offered to upgrade from a 55” screen to a 65” screen. Nope. Wasn’t going to happen. Four weeks later, the check arrived.

Would I ever purchase another Hisense television? Probably not. I think I’m going to take my money and purchase TCL 65” screen from a local big box store. Hisense and their “customer service” sucks.",B09ZQ6NQNR,TV exceeds expectations,Size: 40N5200,5.0 out of 5 stars

"Only owned this about a month so take with a grain of salt but so far it's great, and for the $309 I paid I'd even consider it as a gift for others. In addition, the Amazon delivery people were super helpful and courteous -- lugging it up two flights of stairs, taking it out of the box and even setting up the legs which i couldn't have done on my own. They definitely deserve a union. The TV has a 3.5 mm which I like so that I have the option of attaching multimedia speakers while I'm deciding on a bigger sound system. Wish it would have more RCA plugs but I guess nowadays that's normal, and it has a lot of other connection options. Not used to the Roku interface but it seems user friendly enough. Cautiously hopeful that this discount brand will turn out to be worth following.",B09ZQ6NQNR,"Great TV, but the Remote is Less Than it Should Be.",Size: 32N5300,5.0 out of 5 stars

The number of HDMI, composite and USB ports on the back left side are numerous and generous. The built in media player plays media off a flash drive in the USB port.

"'TV constantly goes back to home screen randomly while using any streaming app. Can be in the middle of a movie and next thing you know, TV goes back to home screen and then you have to open the app and wait for it to load again, but then you have to find where you were interrupted yourself as the TV forgets where it was in that movie. Does it with Netflix, Hulu, Peacock, and Amazon Viedo. Also constantly have a notification that shows the little Android dude and it just says ""Music"" have factory reset the TV and everything and it randomly pops up too. Not worth it at all. Worst Amazon device made to date, although they truly didn't make it, Insignia did. Will NEVER EVER EVER buy INSIGNIA products ever again. Crap products with worse crappy customer service. Should have immediately sent this TV back for a refund!' - My original review August 2022.

Recent software update fixed these issues, my only issue with this version of software is that any commercial interruption while streaming video, will cause the audio and video to be out of sync with one another when the video restarts. The only fix for this is to go back to the Home screen, wait a few minutes and then relaunch the streaming app and restart your video, OR from the home page, click settings, then software, and restart the TV. PRESSING THE POWER BUTTON DOES NOT POWER DOWN THE TV, IT ONLY PUTS IT TO SLEEP (SAME AS YOUR PHONE, TAP IT AGAIN AND IT IS INSTANTLY READY...). So after every single commercial break, the video will be ahead of audio by about 5 seconds, as a lip reader due to hearing impairment, what audio I hear really makes me dizzy trying to focus on the mouth movements to interpret what is being spoken. I have partial loss in one ear, and 90% loss in the other, as a result of military trauma. I rely on reading lips to verify the majority of the sounds I think I hear, for instance, someone might say, ""Nice shoes"" and the sound is muffled by a fan blowing directly toward me, so I think I heard, ""screw you"", ""bless you"", ""who're you"", ""I hate blue"", ""where'sthe crew"", ""...few"", ""...knew"",...the list could go on endlessly. I read their lips and can instantly determine a ""nI-ssss SH-oohs"" by the lip position, and can reply correctly and thank them for the compliment instead of being offended, or my go-to when I can't determine what was said, ""well what do you think?"" to return the ball back in their court, like word tennis. Software updated 3 times and that is the only issue I can't get resolved.

"I bought this on sale and it was a great deal. Assembly was easy, it's sturdy, and the picture quality is great. I use only Prime Video app, none of the (far too) many preloaded Amazon apps. I hate that I cannot delete those preloaded Amazon apps. Why? Because I have recently been getting error messages that my memory is almost full. Erm, what? I have installed only a handful (4 or 5?) apps like Xfinity, Netflix, Hulu, Showtime, Tubi so I can stream. It was a pain to find out how to delete apps. After I cleared out most of my apps, I STILL got the error message. I kept deleting and cleaning out cashes, etc. Finally, I no longer get the error message. Every once in a while, something blips on it and I have to turn off/turn on to fix. If you can put up with some little irritations every once in a while, then this is a great buy. Otherwise, might need to spend a little more money or buy something without Amazon apps that you can't delete. :)",B0875M44Y5,"Great TV, but sound bar recommended",Size: 43-Inches,5.0 out of 5 stars
"When it comes to daily watching like in my living room my go to is samsung tvs. Bought this to replace a older TV in the bedroom . I wouldn't buy this for a living room personally. They tend to get used to various reasons . But a bedroom tv is usually on for a short time frame per day. My girlfriends daughter has a smaller one in her room so I knew what to expect.

The color is nice and bright . The response with the remote feels just like the firestick also not having that extra is nice. The firestick intergration is really the best feature and convenient. It does have various inputs if you choose to use it otherwise. Wallmount is easy to do 39inch is very light equivalent to a 12 pack of soda .

"UPDATE 03/29/2022: (added stars)
Just wanted to update this review. Amazon Customer Service called me shortly after posting this review (wow! impressive timing) and we talked about setting expectations for the performance of this TV. The way it was explained to me: when the TV is used only about half an hour every day it caches data and has to sync up when finally turned on--this takes a little while to catch up and accurately reflects my experience with the TV.

I will stand by this product and say that it is still definitely worth the price paid--it does the job. I might not choose it as my main source of entertainment, but it more than fits the bill in our exercise room. We discussed an easy workaround to circumvent the performance issue: just unplug it when not in use, and this will improve the performance. Easy enough. Thanks again, and frankly I would certainly be tempted to recommend this product on the exceptional customer service, alone. Thanks, as always--happy to be an Amazon customer!!

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
So we bought this TV for the exercise room to pass time while working out. The TV sets up fine. Everything is ""mostly"" fine. I'm not going to review the Amazon software because, frankly, I don't know where one problem begins and the other ends. Confusing, huh? Here's the thing. The TV itself displays a picture--good enough for an exercise room--the sound is as-expected for being in the unit, etcetera.

The problem is with the user interface. Now I DO NOT WANT TO SPECULATE as my software engineering days are over, but right when the TV ""boots up"" it's pretty fast and responsive. However, given the course of about 3-5 hours of being TURNED OFF and plugged into the wall, when reactivated, the TV will become a very slow user experience. I have some network traffic monitors running against my router (i.e. WireShark / Solar Winds), and I see a large amount of wireless traffic coming from the TV when it's not in use. I'm not sure if this is normal or if it was hacked or what, but I just thought I'd let everyone know.

Disabling some of the targetted advertising cut this down a bit, and I have updated the firmware, but I just can't shake the suspicion that the reason for the slowness is either because the device's storage is filling up (with god-knows-what) or that the device is preoccupied with performing some other task. I have also disabled auto-updates for caching the installed applications (just Amazon Prime and YouTube right now). UX is still very slow after being plugged in for a while.

So we've taken to the habit of unplugging it and re-plugging it just before use. Might just leave it unplugged until we actually need it, but the last thing I want is to power it on, and have to wait while it catches up on all the updates.

Don't get me wrong, in concept, the TV is a great idea: integrated with online services, etc, but I just need more time to dig into the actual traffic being sent from it. Maybe a factory reset will help the speed, but I don't want to delete any proof of unoptimized code or anything. Definitely something I think the manufacturer should look into. ""Internet of Things"" devices are inherently insecure, so we rely upon these manufacturers to secure their devices as well as possible when welcoming them into our homes and networks.

I hope this helps your decision. Maybe best to keep it off the network until they can work out these bugs, but then what do you have? DVD/BLURAY TV? Very limited, and kind of defeats the purpose of getting a ""smart"" TV. Anyways, I'm babbling at this point. I hope this helps, and good luck with your purchase!",B0875M44Y5,Decen tv.

"24"" model - unpacking easy but sticky tape around all edges of monitor, cellophane around batteries, sticky tape on remote and legs made it a bit of a trudge. Leg mounting screws were a pain - I don't know if my t.v. was an exception, or the rule - but the holes for the screws were not pre-tapped. Some pressure was required to fully seat all four screws; a good Philips screwdriver is recommended. (Watch the video that's on the Amazon page - you'll notice that the ""unboxing"" guy couldn't get the screws in either and an overlay in text on the video noted to ""Tighten the Screws"". There should be no wobble; wobble isn't for adjusting the t.v. pitch angle, it means the screws are not fully seated. Be careful - you don't want to strip the heads out on those little screws!

Once assembled setup of the t.v. proper was easy but tedious; WiFi connection resulted in a very slow download of apps and operating system - it took perhaps 30 minutes to complete everything. Of course, that will depend upon how many apps you have installed or want to install. My WiFi gives an excellent signal (I'm a retired I.T. tech), but Ethernet beats WiFi everytime so I hooked up an Ethernet cable and things perked up to almost acceptable. No mistake - this is a slow t.v.; I'd recommend Ethernet wherever available. I haven't hooked up a coax antenna yet, so cannot comment on over-the-air broadcast reception.

Sound quality goes right along with the price point of this unit - the price is low and so is the sound quality.

The picture is 720p - so don't expect much, no matter what the paid reviewer on the video reports.

I should note that I ""bought the price, not the t.v.""; I'm using this in my (very) small home office - there's no room on the desk for a second monitor and the Echo Home 8"" device just doesn't cut it for long term viewing of t.v. shows or movies. For my purpose, I'm finding this 24"" t.v. to be acceptable but not terrific. For a small bedroom, travel trailer with 110v available, kitchen, etc. I think this unit is O.K. Even for a kid's room, however, I'd be looking at the upgraded 2022 model for a few bucks more. My ""stars"" score takes into consideration the price point of this t.v. - I wasn't expecting a top-shelf television for this amount of money, and I got what I expected.

"Final Update, I Hope : ) Resolution For WIFI Not Working Or For WIFI Cutting In And Out:

After updating software, resetting the tv, network settings, and infinity router more than 10 times each, trying to get this to work, and doing other things, like unplugging power for 60 seconds, and holding power button down at the tv, and NOTHING worked. I found an amazon review, where they talked about how these tvs have issues because they were programmed or whatever in another country; they said the factory reset worked for them.

Anyways, throughout all my troubleshooting, I finally got wifi to work, but it would just cut on/off and wouldn’t stay connected. BTW, it worked just fine with ethernet cable, after an initial problem getting it to work, at the beginning. Anyway, I work in computer support and am very stubborn when it comes to tech stuff, I just have to figure it out.

I had seen other people talk about resetting the tv through a special hidden service menu, and I did that many times as well, but nothing worked. Anyway, while looking at the special service menu, I thought I would try something, to see if I can get this tv “unstuck” from whatever country it was programmed in... I did the following steps.

-Turned off tv
-Then push Mute, then press 1, then press 8, then press 2 on the remote (make sure the red power light at the bottom of tv blinks each time you push each button, so you know it is taking input)
-Then I powered on tv
-It takes more than a few seconds for the special menu to pop up, and lets you select entries (see screenshots to see what service menu looks like and setting changes I made)
-I selected OPTION, then went down to MRT OPTION, then selected Region, and changed it to KOR (all this will be done with the arrow buttons on remote, the middle button and return button)
-Also, under MRT OPTION, I went to NETWORK SUPPORT, and set it to wifi_int_only (I don’t know if this helped but I figured if I set to wifi only, that it might also help get it “unstuck”)
-I powered off tv, and then back on and checked wifi settings, and of course it wouldn’t pickup anything because it was set to wrong REGION
-I powered off tv, and pressed the MUTE, 1, 8, 2
-Went back in and changed REGION back to USA and NETWORK SUPPORT back to wifi_int
-I powered off tv and back on, and mine picked up my wifi right away; if yours doesn’t just go in and set to wifi and all should work

***BTW, IF YOU ARE LIKE ME, AND TURN OFF YOUR WIFI ROUTER AT NIGHT, MAKE SURE TO TURN IT ON AND LET IT GET ITS CONNECTION, BEFORE TURNING ON TV, OR ELSE, YOU MAY HAVE TO GO THROUGH STEPS ABOVE AGAIN, SETTING REGION TO KOR, ETC! IT'S HAPPENED TO ME TWICE, SO I JUST TURN ON ROUTER, LET IT GET ITS CONNECTION AND THEN TV WORKS SMOOTHLY***

2nd UPDATE:
Well after more than a handful of tv and router resets, I got ethernet to work and it seems remote works better, but still is unresponsive at times. I need this to work on wifi because it is for my other room, which doesn't have ethernet access, but haven't had any luck. Right now I have it on ethernet in my living room, and I have my computer on wifi and all works good, except some remote response issues... Will be sending this one back, was able to recover box because trash crew hadn't picked it up. I ordered a toshiba smart tv, hope this one works a lot better.

Initial Review: Everything Looks Good But Works Horribly
I was able to setup it up and all looks ok as far as sound and picture, but on this second day, it started having connection issues with wifi. I have my computer connected via hdmi, connected via ethernet, not wifi and everything works good, but not when I switch it to smart tv, it's horrible and the remote is HORRIFIC, you push the buttons and it isn't responsive, and you have to keep pushing before it responds. I even changed batteries and it still sucks at responding. WELL, with wifi issues I'm having, I reset the tv to factory and started again, but no luck, it keeps having issues. I tried with my ethernet and no luck. I know my internet connection is good, for like I said, when I switch source to my computer, which is connected to ethernet, all works good. Will keep trying, it sucks because yesterday when all was working good, I threw away the box.",B07YXH57B8,Freaking love this tv,Size: 43-Inch,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I purchased this TV expecting it not to have or do Roku based upon the answered questions. Well, it does. Easy app to install. From the home screen press the left arrow, select ""apps"". Navigate to the top of the screen and ""search"". Type in Roku and install. As easy as that. All the free Roku channels, easy peasy.

It has a crisp clear picture. Would not work well sitting on the floor but is great with the bottom 5 feet from the floor in my bedroom. It is obviously made to be viewed from straight ahead or below the television. The range of view is not as good as I expected. The picture sharpness and clarity is diminished when your head is a foot or more above the TV.
The sound is good but the speakers are directed straight down which makes the sound travel through the wall more than my old TV. I have to reduce the volume to prevent others from hearing it outside my bedroom.

A final note: It does not play well with external Roku devices. I hooked up my Roku to the HDMI prior to learning I could install the Roku app on the television itself. When I powered the TV off and came back a half hour later I missed 30 minutes of the movie. The Roku kept streaming, did not power off with the television. It was a connected device, and would turn the television on when the home button pressed. If you need to view paid content on Roku this would not be the television for you.

"I bought this as a computer monitor for my Windows 10 PC and the image is excellent! However, here is a longer-than-necessary note about a BIG negative experience I initially had, thinking (mistakenly) that it was the fault of this TV. Several days ago I was shocked to discover that whenever a typical alert happened on the computer such as ""printer out of paper,"" etc., there wasn't just a little chime that emanated from the TV, but an ear-splitting blast of sound! I've never experienced this before. My ears actually hurt from the sound blast. Looking for a solution online, my search brought up the ""best"" suggestion which was to go to Settings > Sound > Expert Settings > Sound Feedback > OFF. But... that did NOT shut it off. Then, when I hit the MUTE button to temporarily eliminate the problem, there was an annoying SPEAKER SLASH icon that continual flashed on the screen. Now, here comes my confession of folly, my big ""duh moment."" I finally checked the settings on my faithful PC and realized that, for some reason, my PC's audio setting had jumped to 100%. I'm so glad I checked this because it had never been a problem with my previous monitor -- a 70"" Vizio that had to be replaced because of dying pixels that were creating large dark shadows. SO... after adjusting the PC's audio settings, all is now PERFECT. It's odd because I never tampered with the PC's audio settings.

Maybe a better quality sound bar would link up to it better, but the one I bought with it had to be returned because it only worked for about 10 minutes.

The picture quality is great! It is sharp, bright, and very natural looking. I think the 1080P feature helps too, and is worth the slightly higher cost of this TV over comparable models. But a great picture requires a little extra initial work. When setting up any TV, you'll find that there are many picture adjustment options; some are on/off, some are selections, and some are ranges.

"Good choice for use in a spare room or bedroom. built in speakers audio quality could be better. If you don't opt in on the Smart TV features and data collection you are constantly annoyed with a pop up on power on or exiting from different programming options encouraging you to turn on the Smart features. Why would you not want to turn on Smart features? Perhaps like me you do not want to share your TV usage data with Samsung and 3rd party affiliates. Even with Smart features disabled when you have connected to your home network via Ethernet cable or WiFi you can access shared hard drives on devices attached to your home network. I did not have to enter the userid and password Windows 10 usually requires to access these shared devices between Windows computers. Was able to access the external drive attached to my home router without entering a userid and password, not sure how this magic is happening. May be a security concern for some. The dismal audio quality from the built in speakers reminds me of what I heard watching my parents 1964 vintage Zenith 19 inch black & white TV. Audio quality might improve if you use a soundbar. Was hoping to test it with a pair of good quality amplified computer speakers however the only audio output options are an optical cable or HDMI ARC connection. No Bluetooth. HDMI cable not included with TV. Only cable included is the power cable. Remote control is easy to use and includes numerics making it easy to select off the air channels. Was able to easily configure the remote for my DIRECTV Satellite receiver to control TV power on/off and volume. When turned off a RED LED is illuminated on the bottom right of the TV bezel which may be annoying to some insomniacs.",B07YXH57B8,TV,Size: 55-InchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"It is four stars only because you need an additional gadget to set up bluetooth. The rest is top-notch.
I have this TV for couple weeks and love the picture quality, the size of TV, and the price. Being Samsung TV, it has tons of Samsung TV channels, plus I use smart TV apps, and a few local TV channels I receive with a small indoors antenna (I have no cable TV subscription).
It took to time to set it up, Wi-Fi connection did not work and I use ethernet, but I guess it is caused by the router being in another room.

I am close to illiterate in tech gadgets and I am not paid to promote other Amazon products.
I like to use headphones, but this TV has no bluetooth in it. If you go to TV settings - sound, it says something like HDMI-ARC. After googling all these mysterious words and reading answers about this TV, I bought ""HDMI ARC Adapter Audio Converter""
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0791CFGY1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1
I already had (also bought on Amazon) bluetooth transmitter receiver, and bluetooth headphones.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09DD33SDD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09JGF23V3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

I paired these headphones with bluetooth a few days ago (they said ""paired"" but had no sound).
I connected the converter to the HDMI ARC in TV via HDMI cable, and also to USB in the TV as power supply. Then I connected the converter to the bluetooth transmitter via audio cable (red and white cables), and got a great sound in my headphones.
I had the TV connected to a soundbar via optical cable. Now I can use only soundbar (ot TV speakers without the soundbar), only bluetooth headphones, or both at the same time.
The sound quality is very good. If you are looking for the best listening experience (bass, various music etc.), I can't answer because I was looking for a good quality sound via headphones and I got it.
Overall, I highly recommend this TV.",B07YXH57B8,Not Compatible with Direct TV!,Size: 55-InchStyle: TV Only,4.0 out of 5 stars

"I love the TV, but the remote is pretty wimpy. It’s the same remote (or similar to) the remote we use in the bedroom for the Roku connected to a Panasonic Plasma screen that’s over fifteen years old. Television is perfect. The remote, not so much. It’ll pass, but we’ll probably add a universal remote to replace it and add it to our arsenal. That cost will be added to the overall cost of this television and it’s less than par remote. We’ll remember this and will know better when we begin looking for televisions to replace the older one in the bedroom. We’re also disappointed that there’s no other way to introduce audio to our home theatre system without purchasing a third party piece of equipment that will change the digital audio output to RCA inputs. I know it seems like older technology, but the television doesn’t even provide any Bluetooth capabilities to use a third party device we already have. We will absolutely do more research when it’s time to upgrade the plasma screen in the bedroom. We'll have a similar issue there.

Update: We chose to purchase a Roku Voice Remote that works great with our new television. We’d prefer using a keypad, but this works. We’ll probably still go a different route when we replace the plasma screen in the bedroom.

Update: We woke up one morning and the televise wouldn’t display a picture. We contacted the vendor and they said someone local would come to my house to see what the problem was. Nine days later, a local television repair company showed up. He and his “helper” proceeded to take the circuit board off my television then scratch up the front screen stating the board was bad and the television was no longer operable. I asked what I was supposed to do with the non-working television and he said I’d have to dispose of it myself. I asked about the $469 I had paid for the television six months ago and he said that Hisense would be reaching out to me within 24 hours. Three days later, Hisense called and said they’d be sending me a refund and I should expect a check in the mail in 10-14 days. I asked about them just sending me a replacement set and they told me that this would not be an option. I even offered to upgrade from a 55” screen to a 65” screen. Nope. Wasn’t going to happen. Four weeks later, the check arrived.

Would I ever purchase another Hisense television? Probably not. I think I’m going to take my money and purchase TCL 65” screen from a local big box store. Hisense and their “customer service” sucks.",B08PDR6BQ7,TV exceeds expectations,Size: 65-InchStyle: TV Only,4.0 out of 5 stars

"Only owned this about a month so take with a grain of salt but so far it's great, and for the $309 I paid I'd even consider it as a gift for others. In addition, the Amazon delivery people were super helpful and courteous -- lugging it up two flights of stairs, taking it out of the box and even setting up the legs which i couldn't have done on my own. They definitely deserve a union. The TV has a 3.5 mm which I like so that I have the option of attaching multimedia speakers while I'm deciding on a bigger sound system. Wish it would have more RCA plugs but I guess nowadays that's normal, and it has a lot of other connection options. Not used to the Roku interface but it seems user friendly enough. Cautiously hopeful that this discount brand will turn out to be worth following.",B08PDR6BQ7,"Great TV, but the Remote is Less Than it Should Be.",Size: 75-InchStyle: TV Only,2.0 out of 5 stars

"I got this tv for several reasons
- my tv of 10+ years died
- I’m retired
- I wanted a smart tV
- I deserve to splurge lol
- Price
- Size

My issue is after trouble shooting and calling customer service having several ppl transfer me going over the same steps with five different ppl and then waiting for them to get back to me because they couldn’t help and had to kick my issue up to another department
AFTER ALL OF THAT I get an email that tells me to reset everything which I’d done several times already and then they send instructions to go to my PC computer and down load something on my PC ( which I don’t own) put it on a usb drive and put it on the TV etc etc etc
Problem with that is
1. I’m an apple person
2. I’m retired from the entertainment industry and my laptop retired with me I literally gave it away
So 3. There are no computers in my house (well that’s not exactly true I have my original desktop square tan Mac from 1988 but I haven’t booted it up in over 25 years) but if there were a computer it wouldn’t be a PC

Of all the ppl I know I literally don’t know anyone who owns a PC

So that was the reason for me just giving up after exchanging this TV and having the same issues with the second one

Okay so these were the 2 issues I had on the 2 TVs I received and ended up returning back to Amazon

These issues were happening among several apps peacock 🦚 TV, Paramount TV, YouTube, HBO, Disney+, and Hulu

First and most annoying
1/4 of the screen is cut off. Why? No idea. example on peacock 🦚 tv I put on a film and it is a “Focus Feature film” on the screen I would see FOC and the next line Feat

I put on a move id seen or tv show and half of someone’s face was gone just cut off

On say HBO or on Disney I will have the whole picture BUT I have to have the sound all the way up to the maximum Volume be in complete silence or you can’t hear anything and even then keep the subtitles on God forbid someone whispers on screen you won’t be able to hear that shit LITERALLY

I’m not against doing the work. I know everything is not perfect for everyone. I understand you get want to pay for and you may have to do more work when you pay less for things.
I just think this tv is for a PC person due to its issues not being fixable with out owning a PC. In order to get the firmware you have to down load and install you need a PC believe me I tried on a friends MacBook and it can’t be done on the tv itself.

So mixed reviews for this TV
It’s not a bad tv
The picture is great when you get the whole picture the sound is great when you get normal sound but if like me you aren’t a PC person then buyer beware if the firmware ever needs to be upgraded it will require you to do so with a PC",B09WQ3FQ2G,Delivered a day early,Size: 43-InchStyle: TV Only,4.0 out of 5 stars

"I agree with the other people that said the legs suck. They're really bad. Way too small for the TV which wants to pitch forward. It really does need to be in a wall mount and they could add 25 bucks to the price to solve a problem or they could spend more than a dollar on the legs in the first place.

This TV freezes, sticks, stutters to the point that it has to be unplugged to reboot itself. This happens across many apps and when going through HDMI. It can happen after 10 minutes or 3 hours. I have updated it.

It truly is a shame. This TV has a beautiful picture. It adjusts to the light in the room and the colors are stunning. I have a Sanyo in my living room that doesn't look this good. The stereo sound is great and it will get very loud and not break up. It's perfect for my bedroom. I really wish it worked.

I cannot rent movies from Amazon or Vudu with this television. From Amazon the message says to ""use your phone or computer to rent this movie"" which really makes me wonder about this operating system.

"Honestly an ideal pick for a dorm/studio where space is limited and you want the feeling of a TV that you can’t get with a monitor. Android TV is fairly comprehensive although the low Ram and potential manufacturing QC issues (they are manufactured in India, I know because mine was still set there regionally) can make it hard for non tech savvy users to get the most out of their experience. Works for gaming but wouldn’t recommend for anything with Latency being critical to gameplay. Sound quality is nothing impressive whatsoever but is perfectly passable and can get loud enough for the type of space you’d use this in.

"As you can see from the picture, the FIRST TV I was sent was not an acceptable product. And honestly, I believe they sent this shattered screen one on purpose because I called & complained about a delivery hold up, so I believe they just grabbed a broken one & threw it on the truck because I suddenly & very quickly got it like the next day, strangely enough. Even more strange was that the two capable gentlemen who delivered this one had it strapped securely to the inside rear of the truck with absolutely nothing around it (in an empty 10ft radius) that could've damaged it so badly & they were not reckless or dropsy, so I'm still not sure how a TV shipped & handled that securely got shattered across the entire front of the screen while being handled by such careful pros. Thankfully the replacement was much better and I received a free, ""DELUXE DELIVERY & UNBOX"" which was a very misleading thing because when they got here w/ the TV, the young gentleman in charge continually explained how they could do nothing but take it out of the box, plug it in and ensure operation, which amounted to making sure it turned on, and then take the box and leave. That's it, that's all! They literally wouldn't even help me lift it onto the table where it was to sit. I still don't know what was ""DELUXE"" about this Deluxe Delivery & Unbox. Oh, & the same guy complaining about all they couldn't do for me instead of focusing on what he could do? He also had to (quite annoyingly) repeatedly tell me that they weren't even ""supposed to deliver to you because of the construction"" going on in what used to be our apt bldg's parking lot. Yet Amazon delivers here practically everyday. But for some strange reason he was insistent that the construction out front was a definite No No for Amazon deliveries (or maybe he meant just for TV deliveries). I'm stil not sure. Either way, still makes no sense.
So now to the TV. I ordered this 65"" Samsung Crystal Tizen for TWO MAIN REASONS.
1) It had a voice remote & 3 voice assistants to choose from, but since I like Google & they were pushing this as a Google TV w/ Google Assistant, that was a big selling point for me. Actually the biggest selling point. I knew I could very easily connect my already established Google Assistant like I had done on a 4K Chromecast I bought from Walmart in 2020. But sadly, THAT NEVER HAPPENED! After speaking extensively to Samsung TV support, Google & Google Assistant support, Amazon support, & even some support chat bots & emails & community support forums & you name it, I tried it. The best advice I got to simply move forward from this nightmare fiasco was to go ahead & just use one of the other two remaining voice assistants that were still available on the TV, Samsung's Bixby, or Amazon's Alexa. Both of which I dislike. What I had seen of Samsung's Bixby from interaction with it on my Samsung Galaxy phones and tablets was that it was fully advertisement saturated, and I dislike that immensely. Whereas Amazon's Alexa is just one big speaking algorithm designed primarily for nothing more than selling more Amazon merchandise. I don't need that on my TV remote & I'm also not buying another device to connect to it just to get it to work properly with the TV. Because of course if you select Alexa as your voice assistant they immediately try to upsell you into an Echo or some other unnecessary thing you don't need to operate a voice assistant on your TV remote. I've been using Roku voice remotes for 3 or 4 yrs now & they work just fine w/ their system as is. No extra device purchase necessary. My Google Chromecast works amazingly well with its Google Assistant voice remote. Both of those items were less than $100 each. Buuuut, a brand new 65"" 4K Samsung Crystal Tizen has the WORST voice assistant remote I've ever encountered. And it WILL NOT HOOK UP TO GOOGLE ASSISTANT. So, on to the . . . .
2nd REASON I PURCHASED THIS TV?
Because it had 4K UPSCALING!!! What a huge feature in a TV this inexpensive! I'd purchased a Sony Blu-ray player w/ 4K upscaling and it was amazing. I fell in love with how old DVD movies were brought up to nearly 4K quality with doing nothing more than putting the movie in the carriage and pushing play. So when I saw that this Samsung Crystal Tizen had 4K upscaling in all picture viewing formats, BOOM, I was all in. That 4K upscaling & the 4K picture clarity in it's Dynamic viewing mode have been the ONLY redeeming qualities in this entire fiasco of a purchase.
Talk about a bunch of ridiculous false advertising, pitiful customer support & delivery inadequacies, & more difficulty & flawed merchandise than one person should have to endure in an entire year? But of course these are all avoidable issues that I somehow created on my own when I clicked, ""Add to cart"" & made a purchase, fully believing & trusting that i was going to receive what i had read & saw with my own eyes, in the time i was told I'd receive it.
(Speaking of, did I mention the reason I called and complained about the delayed shipping to begin with was that my item, the broken TV in the picture, had been sitting in a little suburb about 20 minutes outside of town for going on 2 days and had not moved according to the tracking details? Which is why i believe when I called to inquire about it, that is what they sent me. Nearly 2 days in one spot 20 mins away from me? What would you do?)
Oh, & apparently I'll never have Google Assistant on this TV. It just won't connect. Keeps telling me to login & connect but won't let me. I've been FORCED to use Samsung's Bixby as the voice assistant for the TV & remote. UGGGHHHHH!!!
IN CLOSING - ITS A GOOD TV FOR THIS PRICE, BUT IF THEY RAISE THE PRICE? LOOK ELSEWHERE. AND REMEMBER, THE ONE FEATURE YOU'RE PERSONALLY AFTER? THE ONE FEATURE THAT MAY BE THE SELLING POINT THAT SOLD YOU ON THIS TV? IT'S HIGHLY POSSIBLE IT MAY NOT WORK OR WORK CORRECTLY. It's also a very high possibility that if you run into shipping and delivery issues, you can end up with a broken TV and have to do a long & painstaking, time consuming, long time waiting for your money back, refund and return.

"I am finding many,many features to adjust and turn on or off to control every day. The speakers are OK for normal sound and an EQ can be enabled. I bought 2 Bluetooth 5.0 headsets from SoundCore and noticed some inputs had that Bluetooth sound sync mismatch showing lips moving too late or early. I read about AptX LL (low latency) enabled TV and Headsets required for Video use with syncing sound with video. The sync off because I FF or RW streaming bit too much ...with non AptX phones I feared I had to buy 2 new headphones but it went away by it self. HDMI input #2 has the advanced type HDMI plug. I used that for my Xfinity Arris 4K cable box with a DVR HDrive or SSD. You need the small new XG1v4 DVR/cable box to output 4K to TV from them or they can send the tiny non-DVR one to go with normal HD box that does cloud only 4K. The only problem is the XG1v4 4K DVR cannot be controlled by the small Universal Remote provided currently. I tried the 20 attempts many times and even chose Arris as the manufacturer and the model #AX014ANM and the XG1v4 name and nothing works yet like on the other Xfinity boxes I had for a while. It says make sure your cable box is set for IR infrared to work but the cable box is fixed RF radio frequency only not dual type. Too bad the Remote is not dual output. Have to have 2 remotes.

"Delivery was fine, I guess. It was a “drop and run” situation - last time we ordered a TV from Amazon delivery was via a private company that actually unpacked it and plugged it in. This was delivered by Amazon and it was left on our porch with no knock or doorbell ring.

This TV Arrived with damage to the box and the back of the TV crushed. Miraculously the TV worked but we still returned because we were concerned that the the back would give out when mounted.

They picked up 5 days after delivery and it was picked up 6 days ago - not sure how long it would take to get back to Amazon to credit my card. We are still waiting as it says return started but there is no confirmation of pickup or any easy way to track it online since it’s a private 3rd party company which is concerning. That experience will determine if we order a replacement via Amazon or Costco.

The picture was good, set up easy through Samsung app that we had to download. The remote is weird/wonky and the interface is kind of clunky. I don’t love that.

"Bought this TV to replace a 6 year old Samsung. Very happy with it.
As others have said, if you want the best TV to hook up your $1500 gaming pc to or play the best of the best Xbox series X games on at the highest settings, you can find better tvs (for a lot more money)

But if you want a very good TV to watch sports, streaming, movies and regular shows, this is great.

I'm a bit puzzled as to why others said the TV sound is bad. We have another 4-5 year old TCL tv, and this tv sounds much better. We even have a $200 sound bar hooked up to the old tv....I tried hooking that soundbar up to this TV and it was only a slight improvement over the speakers in the TV.
Of course, buy yourself an expensive soundbar or one with a seperate subwoofer and it will sound better, but this TV for sure sounds better than similar TVs just a couple years old.

The Biggest thing I was concerned about was the Roku smart TV features. We have a Cable app built in (as we did on our old Samsung TV) and it responded VERY slowly on the Samsung. Happy to say it is much quicker on the TV.

In the menu it does have various settings so you can get the picture quality to just how you like it (color temp, color level, brightness/contrast, sharpness, etc) and has a few different sound settings built in also you can change between.

I have bought TV's in the past that I returned because I simply did not like something about them. not this one, this is a very good entry/mid level TV for the price.",B09QY14MZS,Great TV,Size: 43 inStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"This is our second TCL TV. We bought a 55 inch TCL about four years ago and it has been an outstanding unit. Around the same time we bought a 50 inch Sharp Roku TV that honestly neither of us was ever 100% happy with. It just seemed very unstable and glitchy with the controls and the picture wasn’t that great either.

This TCL arrived in a timely manner the box was perfect and the TV was very easy to unpack and set up. Probably less than 20 minutes. The sound is good the picture is very good.

The one and only thing I would improve relates to the one feature of the Sharp TV that I really did like. There is only one audio out jack which is for headphones. When you plug in headphones the built-in speakers are unenabled. That was one nice feature of the sharp TV, it had a direct audio out and a separate headphone jack so I could listen on my headphones while my wife listened on the speakers because my hearing is not as good as hers. Other than that one thing we are very happy with the TCL unit and would recommend it .",B09QY14MZS,Great TV,Size: 43 inStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Might not be the best picture quality available, but it is pretty dang good. If you are upgrading from an older TV (5ys+ old) this picture will be incredible to you. I have recently purchased a 55"" Sony Bravo as well (the connectivity options and sound quality on the Bravo are far better) and when I first got it, I had them side-by-side and honestly thought the TCL had a better picture with my HD cable. Blu-ray, I couldn't see a difference. In short, buy a high quality sound bar (ARC) for this TV and you are still at half the price of the comparably-size Bravo. Fantastic deal. This review will probably upset the electronic snobs out there, but most people don't care that there are 10 picture settings in a TV and aren't going to take the time to switch the setting depending on every viewing situation they are in.

"Hoping this helps with your decisions.

So, wish we had vid/pic the product to post along with this review. Package was in the simple original carton only. That said, UPS handled it very well as there were zero damage or wear to the carton at all & we gladly accepted the delivery.
The carton gave instructions on how to open the TV the easiest and safest. It was inner wrapped in plastic with an additional thick foam and cardboard shield between the carton and protected screen.
Every item was attached to find easily & no loss or damage.

The set itself is a great economical entry/midrange tv. Picture is on par and the bundled Roku software lends many viewing options. Wireless network setup on TV is easy especially bc we knew our password. Its not clear if any push to connect option was available as we don’t allow that option on our residential wireless. Hardwire network option is available, though our wireless is substantial to hold and serve many endpoints.
Updates were automatically verified and then the Roku app setup begins with simple date time and zipcode verification. If you are familiar it is identical as a external Roku setup. If not familiar, Roku is easy to navigate and select or deselect channels and setup.
You will find 4 HDMI ports one supporting (ARC). If you aren’t familiar with hdmi(arc) devices, suggest you Google else you will miss out on a optional device interface, like controlling a sound bar.
Speaking of sound bar… my only “con” about this set is the rather ‘cheap’ sound it produces by itself. Actually the sound isn’t too bad for a down and back firing sound. I assume the reason for the speaker position is more for wall mounting (not included) and provide a sleek frontal look with a equally 1/2” ‘borderless appearance.
If you plan to use the factory feet/stand just know your lower clearance is around 2” from bottom of set to your counter, tv stand top. Making the audio sound seem a little strange, however you will acclimate to the bass lacking internal sound.
The set itself, it is rather light in comparison to older LCD/LED/Plasma.
A feature beyond a cable box remote controller, enjoyed by our family is the direct ability to adjust volume from the simple Roku remote included.
All in all…this is an excellent value. It’s not a set to ‘crow about up and down the neighborhood, on NFL superbowl weekend HOWEVER you will not be embarrassed by this set in anyway. Kid to the in-laws will love it.

Recommend: Consider a sound bar which are also offered at reasonable $ by same manufacturer & for just this TV model. (So the manufacturer actually knew the sound is anemic and gamble you will have or upgrade with a sound bar…)",B09QY14MZS,Great TV,Size: 55 inStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I like the tv overall, there’s just a few complaints. If you pause a program after a couple minutes the tv shuts itself off. The sound quality is poor.

I also set up payments and they tried to take the payment 5 days earlier then they were supposed too!, and then the payment was unsuccessful because I didn’t have enough money in my acct to pay it.

"This Roku TV is an excellent deal for $300. I honestly was not expecting much for that price. The image quality is really good considering how much it costs. Obviously a $1000 TV is going to give you ridiculously good image quality, but honestly who cares, the image quality on this is just fine, not pixely at all, and you can adjust the brightness and color settings.
I am also really pleased with Roku. Prior to this I had a smart TV that was not Roku. It really adds a lot of different channels and free apps for infinite things to view. If you have app subscriptions already you can just sign in, it doesn't charge you extra. It also loads really quickly.
As far as regular cable TV I haven't figured out how to pause, rewind, fast forward or any other features yet, which were advertised with the Roku program.

"The TCL roku tv is the best interface on earth for cord cutters. Why? Because once you hook this tv to a good antenna, you will not only get a great picture but a menu. Not just any menu to view what is on tv right now, but a menu to show you what is coming up. TCL is so high tech for cord cutters, by adding a USB drive to the tv you can pause live tv. This is amazing. imagine watching your favorite show but you need a bathroom break. Just press pause and when you come back you can resume. What an amazing free feature. Now if you have internet in your home you will also get free tv channels. At least a hundred free stations that are a part of your guide. Its basically like having basic cable without a monthly fee. The tv will pay for itself in 12 months. About the sound, it is high end sound. You can use headphones and a sound bar but the sound is really good and immersive. About the picture, I suggest you go to sports mode. Go to settings and put it on sports mode because it will be operating in 120 motion mode and the picture quality is great and bright with great contrast. You will get your best picture in sports mode. The best sound is when you go to sound settings and combine the bass with enhanced sound for speech. it is just a button click. In my opinion, if you are a cord cutter a TCL tv has the best combination of features, sound and picture quality. I have owned other brands and still do, but NOTHING compares to a TCL for a true cord cutter. NOTHING! Nothing beats newer tvs because it is made for a cord cutter.

"I’m a week and ½ into the TCL series 4, 65 inch ownership experience. I’m really pleased up to this point.
I replaced a 55 inch LG which simply stopped working. I had been doing research on new flat screens because the LG was acting funny and I wanted to be prepared. I had a ROKU device attached to the LG so the choice of a ROKU TV was a given. I do like the O.S. and user interface.
Pretty plain, but that’s the nature of all flat screens. It’s simple plain plastic frame with nothing taking up screen real estate. There is a button on the front bottom that allows control of the device if you lose the remote. I bought a spare non OEM remote for $5.00, I would recommend it. The remote combined with the ROKU interface has a lot of options in spite of the remote only having a few buttons. I do miss numbers on the remote however.
So the weirdness is the default settings. When I turned it on the initial impression was the screen was not bright and actually kind of flat and boring. After learning all the settings I found one that was set to “low power.” I flipped it to “normal” and a brilliant picture showed up. The same goes for the sound. I set that to theater and a clear more dynamic sound arrived. I don’t know why TCL would set a default to a sub optional setting, but they did. Of course the product literature was of limited value, just had to experiment.

"Replaced my 65"" OLED B7a from 2017 with a 77"" C2 and I've been running it for a week as of now. The picture quality after calibration has improved over the older model. I feel the black levels on this device are far far better than the B7a ever were, which BTW required a lot of ""tinkering"" to get to what the C2 did pretty much out of the box. My old OLED had no burn-in that I could see, even after 5 years of daily usage, but the older OLED panel was never as uniform in solid colors test as this panel is, not even when the B7a was new. Especially watching dark scenes now, there is no fixed pattern noise anymore.

The scene motion on this TV is better what the B7a has, which was already good, but it had issues with some stuttering under certain conditions. Obviously this TV is 120hz with a 5 year newer video processing unit, so it would be expected to be a good improvement.

The worst part for me during initial setup was figuring out the new WebOS UI. Coming from the older B7a WebOS, which had things in different places and required different steps to get things done was quite frustrating at first. I guess once you understand how it works its okay.

After setting the TV like I wanted, I then updated the firmware and after the firmware update things didn't work right, things like LG channels got stuck, couldn't click out of some popups, etc, so I had to perform a factory reset, and redo the whole setup again. The TV has been running well since. So be aware that if you perform a hardware reset, chances are you might have to do a factory reset and redo all the settings.

The remote internal accelerometer wasn't calibrated somehow when I first paired it, so the pointer kept always pulling to the left on the screen. To resolve this I had to shake the remote several times until it finally became accurate. The scroll wheel feels a bit too deep this time compared to the previous magic remote from the B7a, which was way too high... guess the next TV will be at the sweet spot! :)

IMO. For the price of this TV I would've liked some backlight on the remote too. I did miss not having a pause button on the remote like the B7a. Which was nice to pause shows without having to bring the menu and click on the pause screen button.

Connectivity for DLNA worked well, the NAS and other storage stuff in my LAN was detected fine after everything was setup correctly.

Mobile screen cast via Miracast, etc... worked well with all my phones/tablets that are capable of screen cast.

All the basic streaming services I've tried worked well too.

Audio from the default speakers is certainly okay for a TV, and it seems to have improved the spatial audio somehow over the older B7a. Still no match for a dedicated receiver/speakers setup, but if you don't have one, this TV alone will be a good start.

Privacy was and is still a concern for me with this TV. And let me say it loud and clear: Serving ads on a 2500 dollar TV feels quite a bit of an insult, TBF; b/c at that point why not just give the TV away for free? if you are going to soak the end user in ads, and sell their usage stats, etc at some good $$$?
I believe most of the tracking, etc can be disabled by going into the agreements and disabling all the options there. For most of the basic B7a level of functionality that I wanted I only had to agree with the two first terms, so voice and all other terms are not enabled, which still is a bit of a concern to trust if a company will honor a checkbox... Also, the remote seems to have a built-in microphone, so if you are super concerned about this thing eavesdropping then you can just take the batteries out of the remote, or use an universal remote but you lose the nice mouse-like pointer. The old B7a remote doesn't seem to offer full functionality with the C2, at least not the mouse pointer part.

Overall the TV was a step up from the B7a, both in size and picture quality. Only time will tell how the TV pans out in the end, but if the B7a was an indication, working well for 5 years, I think this TV should last at least the same amount of time.",B09RMLLJPX,I recommend,Size: 43 inStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"First week impression: visually stunning with some annoying quirks as a computer monitor.

I purchased this to replace an aging Seiki SM40UNP. I use it exclusively as a computer monitor, both for work and gaming. Visually the LG is in a different league than the Seiki. Colors are more vivid, it's much brighter, and blacks are like a portal to the endless void. These differences were apparent before enabling HDR, and then HDR bumped up the colors and brightness even further. During HDR calibration I flinched and cursed to an empty room when it switched from black to white; it was blinding. For gaming this is good stuff. I played some games with native HDR and some games with Windows Auto HDR. I ended up disabling Auto HDR because I thought it made some games look over-saturated, but that's probably just personal preference. Native HDR looks great.

The same visual fidelity that's great for games is a little overwhelming when using the monitor as a workstation, particularly when reading black text on a white background. Even after cranking the SDR brightness in Windows down to its lowest level, I can feel eye strain starting after just an hour of reading text. Some people have suggested that this has more to do with Windows' HDR implementation than the monitor itself; I don't know. Whatever the cause, I prefer the drab presentation of the Seiki monitor for reading/editing text. I'm typing this review on an old LCD monitor because it's more comfortable than doing it on the LG.

OLED protection features are also a bit annoying at times. E.g. if the TV detects that the input it's showing is mostly unchanging, it will slowly dim the screen. Unfortunately, typing into a dark-themed text editor seems to count as ""mostly unchanging"". Every 10 minutes or so I need to grab a bright window and shake it to wake the monitor from its apparent stupor. It's like trying to keep a tired puppy awake. I disabled other features like logo dimming that seemed to be causing problems, so this whole-screen dimming is the only one that continues to irk me. I also voluntarily use a black wallpaper and configure the Windows taskbar to auto-hide to protect the panel from burn-in; make sure you know what you're getting into if you're going OLED for the first time.

The most significant weakness of this TV is that it is... well, a TV. It's a bad sign when you have to use a remote control to agree to a privacy policy before using a computer monitor. It's not plug-and-play, it's plug-and-read-reddit-thread-and-modify-dozens-of-settings-and-play. After spending a couple hours researching and fiddling with settings there are still some things I'm not happy with. For instance, the TV doesn't enter standby the way purpose-built computer monitors do. When the computer stops sending a signal the TV takes over and shows vibrant wallpapers for a while before turning off completely, such that you have to turn on the TV again separately from waking up the computer. Maybe there's a setting to change this - if there is, I may never find it.

The final quirk is a graininess most noticeable in uniform blocks of grayish colors, which unfortunately feature prominently in many dark-themed applications. It appears to be caused by slight variation in pixel color. The grain is visible at a viewing distance of 24 inches / 60 cm, but IMO it's only distracting if you're closer than 18 inches / 45 cm.",B09RMLLJPX,Great,Size: 43 inStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"This 77” LG C2 OLED TV is absolutely breathtaking. This is the best picture quality I’ve personally ever seen and it actually exceeded my expectations. Of course you get stunning contrast, colors, and crisp 4K scenes, but I want to call out some lesser mentioned features that I’ve already come to love.

- Magic remote: the Nintendo WII style cursor that allows you to navigate all apps either through traditional remote buttons or via the aim and click method is great - providing a new way of doing things but allowing you to still use traditional buttons. Also allows for equipment control to control my Samsung sound bar.
- WebOS: unlike my older LG tv, now all my streaming apps are native to tv. I get to ditch the Fire tv cube for paramount plus and HBO max
- Alexa integration works nicely
- Game mode, presets like FPS, RPG etc make switching for each game super easy. Already this tv has given an upper edge in FPS games.
- Sound- for some reason all sound is crisper
- Airplay: iOS screen mirroring and airplay work great, as well as screen mirroring from my MacBook Pro. I didn’t realize this was a feature.

Only downside so far is the Picture in Picture / split screen not working (seen other reviewers having same experience). It would be great to be able to play a game and have Netflix in a PIP window. Hopefully future software updates will fix this.",B09RMLLJPX,Great TV!,Size: 43 inStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Where to start? Beautiful picture 4k and SD, outstanding sound, well thought out design. It's all that and more. However, a diagram of the inputs and outputs would be REAL handy, especially when trying to plug things in, And just what do you do with the little plastic pieces (finally found in the one page instruction sheet). And the same goes for the, what I assume to be, IR blasters? Since it is set up for the PC that gloriously melted down when I attached it to the monitor (I should point out that the Alienware died while the Pi 4 8GB and little NUC never had a problem with it), I can not say how it looks for gaming and will be moving it and taking photos of the port connections and label them in the photo for future reference. I also found it to be a royal pain to find anything on LG's website. I still haven't registered it because my model does not exist yet. I hate time paradoxes! Okay, fine let's look for any manuals. Oh. I see. searching support gives an article Google Stadia issues, and another that tries to sell me one. Not holding out hopes for any support, at least for a while. It really makes me wonder if the fire sale pricing is a way to get rid of stock...

In short, don't buy unless you are techy, geeky, or know someone who is, and treat then we because they will be your support for this beautiful monitor. I know I am ripping on it, but as I said earlier, it has a beautiful picture, outstanding sound, well thought out design (if they only documented it better).

ps I will be taking my monitor feet/legs to a local machine shop to make a set of T-feet that can attach via drilled out holes to raise and secure it.",B09RMLLJPX,Few annoyances. Overall good.,Size: 55 inStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars

"#1 son installed the TV following the directions provided, connecting the cable and Blu-ray player was simple. One remote included. Cable remotes can turn set on or off but can’t move through the menu, need the Lg remote for that and signing into apps.

Great bright picture from any angle, some older TV shows & movies automatically show in old formats that don’t fill the screen. Internet ready, but it has an app for the ones I use and no info on what else I could do with it.

This TV, like so many devices now, does not come with even a basic instruction booklet on how to use all the features, so stumbling your way around is required to set up your Disney+ or Netflix, or what the unmarked colored buttons are for, etc. For all I know it may cook my dinner but I’ll never find that feature!

I would love to tell you that this tv is great. It looks awesome at the Best Buy that i saw it at. But I will continue to have to wait to get my hands on this tv. Their attempt to deliver this tv failed on epic proportions. My wife and I were here waiting all day for this tv. I left my phone in the bedroom while I took a quick shower. They called my phone while I was in the shower and did not bother to knock on the door. They said no one was home and rescheduled the delivery. I called the number back 4 minutes after they called; for them to tell me there was no way to get a hold of the driver and I would have to reschedule. The delivery truck comes from somewhere in Houston TX and I live in college station tx which about 2-2.5 hours depending on traffic. They were in my drive way and because I didn’t answer my phone they are going to reschedule a delivery that it over a hundred miles away simply because they did not knock on the door.

"Coming from a Acer Predator 34 inch curved monitor, the size increase of this monitor isn't a shock. The width is similar, but there is more vertical height for sure. I will say that for a monitor sitting on a desk, 42 inches is about the limit for me. Any larger and you are turning your head too much.

I also recommend a monitor arm so you can move this around easily. So often in the past I have done without it and once you get an arm, you wont want to deal with something sitting on your desk. Especially a 42 inch monitor or tv.

It's a great OLED display with plenty of brightness. It supports G-Sync / FreeSync and variable refresh rate (VRR) @ 120hz. It has inky blacks as all good OLED screens do. The auto white balance is not too annoying for PC use in my opinion.

Since its a 4k screen, I do organize windows in all 4 corners of the display for work and I am sure that we will see a small amount of image retention eventually. Time will tell. I haven't turned off any of the self protecting features of the TV and don't plan to. Nothing annoying to report as a result. There is also a pixel cleaning feature that runs as needed already if this works similar to C1 models.

It really is one of the best displays I have ever used both in terms of color, black levels, response time, and clarity.

"8/14/22 update: LG got the parts out fairly quickly and a local electronics company did the repair in less than an hour. They replaced the screen, not a board.

I reiterate that the TV itself is a 5 — it’s got a fantastic picture and I have 30+ years of broadcast TV production experience so I know what I’m talking about.

But I’m only updating my rating to 4/5 instead of 5/5 because of LG’s service process.

When I opened the original repair ticket, LG automatically provided troubleshooting recommendations. I had already followed the instructions that are available online and told them so. However, there’s no ability to attach a picture to the ticket and they automatically close the original ticket and then ask you to open a new ticket with all of the same information that was provided previously in case troubleshooting doesn’t fix the problem.

Once the second ticket was entered LG eventually asked for a picture but then they didn’t make it available to the repair facility so they asked for a picture as well.

Start to finish, time to repair completion was about a week and the TV was not completely down during this time. But I think LG’s repair ticket workflow needs some tweaks

"This is my second LG and third led flat screen. The screen here is incredibly thin (at least at the top) and the whole unit was much lighter than my previous 65 inch. That made it easy to mount by myself. The picture is beautiful and because I have shades on all the windows of my TV room the brightness is more than adequate (knew OLEDs can have a brightness problem but this model--and the next higher--have been reviewed as quite good in the brightness area.) Because I had an LG previously, I am quite familiar with the controls and the options although the OS in much updated from my previous unit, but that is part of why I bought new. Now I can do any and all streaming directly from the TV without needing to go through my cable service and/or a Fire cube as I was doing. It is also very convenient that the TV controls the on/off of the new AV receiver I also just bought (down to only two remotes!). The only difficulty I had in getting everything setup was to get the lip sync correct which ended up requiring that I bypass any corrections from both the TV and Receiver.

"Hi Everyone,

This is an excellent entry-level 4K TV at a good price with a 1-year warranty! I have been using this TV for over 3 months before writing any reviews or comments. I did a lot of research before buying a new TV and this was considered the best lower-cost 4K TV with Roku that was available. I Highly recommend this TV.

You do need to have an Internet connection and email address to register with Roku to use all the superb streaming options. You can always create a free email account just for TV stuff if you don't want to use your main email. You do not need to add a payment method (credit card or debit card, etc...) unless you want to, otherwise, just select to skip that. You can always sign up for additional streaming services, called channels, on the internet using your computer or smartphone and they will work when added to your Roku channels.

So far, I am very impressed with the picture quality, especially when streaming any of the Roku channels (streaming services), or viewing video files, or DVD + Blu-Ray discs, or through the Live TV over the air (OTA) antenna. Anything with 720p resolution or higher looks great, very nice upscaling, and anything with HDR is awesome. Even on my low speed 5 Mbps internet connection, the streaming looks really good, yet for 4K video streaming it is recommended to have a min. 15 Mbps to 25 Mbps+ internet connection.

Totally recommend using a quality surge protector or UPS (battery backup) with any electronics you care about.

I suggest running a software update in the system settings after setting up the TV for the first time, it is automatic after that. Also, this TV has a large bright LED activity light that stays on disturbing my sleep which you can disable in the settings. You can also select a default startup option like the HDMI input 1 (HDMI cable box on mine), Live TV (coax cable or antenna), or the main Roku menu (the default setting), etc...

Initially, I was disappointed with the HOA-required Comcast Xfinity cable service because the picture quality was not nearly as good as the streaming options, or when viewing video files from my media server or USB or DVD Blu-Ray discs or Live TV antenna. But, that is because the Xfinity Comcast cable DTA box is only at 480i and even the free upgraded HDMI DTA cable box is only at 720p or 1080i and the picture quality is just okay. FYI: Progressive (p) video format is better than Interlaced (i). I find that the cable box picture looks better at 720p or 1080i with the TV picture gaming setting enabled and it is still not nearly as good as 720p or 1080p from streaming channels or antenna or video files or discs. Any dark scenes using cable box HDMI are almost too dark to distinguish details, very annoying. I tried 3 HDMI cables, HDMI 2, high speed HDMI 2, and 4K HDMI 2.1 which didn't help. The coaxial connection has lower resolution, but the dark scenes look better and whatever your watching will stabilize and look better overall. The only way to get higher quality video from Xfinity Comcast cable is through their free Streaming app and your Internet service provider (ISP) or by using their free TV WiFi box which I think requires using their Xfinity Internet Service (X1 Wireless TV Box (Xi5 or Xi6) or Flex streaming TV Box (Xi5, Xi6 or XiOne).

Additional comments: I was surprised that a TV purchased in April 2022 and manufactured in January of 2022 did not have USB v3.x port(s) and HDMI v2.1 or newer ports although it does have an HDMI v2.1 audio Arc port, but not the enhanced eArc port. The HDMI Arc port can be used as a 3rd regular HDMI port if not used for audio. More ports would be really nice. This model has a 60 Hz display refresh rate with a 120 Hz CMI (Clear Motion Index); This is not a true 120 Hz display refresh rate, but I have not noticed any negative video refresh related issues except on low-quality videos or slower Internet. Note: Some new gaming systems may require an HDMI 2.1 port and an actual 120 Hz refresh rate. There is no Bluetooth either. Also, the included TCL Roku remote does not have the voice button, yet my $40 Roku Streaming Stick + remote has the voice button??? The Roku app on my Android phone does have the voice option though when connected to the TCL TV.

And, the Roku Media Player could use some major updates and or perhaps porting VLC into Roku because I noticed that some videos either through my media server or video files on USB drive would not play audio correctly because this TV cannot handle all the various video and audio formats like 7 or 8 channel audio, yet they all play well on my computers, and the video playback navigation controls may or may not work with various media servers? The Plex media server app works well. The Roku Media Player with USB drives does not seem to recognize the exFat file system either which is a common format.

Finally, I would also recommend getting an extended warranty through Amazon or through TCL.",B08DHFX4FV,Very nice so far love. The picture,Size: 50-inchConfiguration: TV only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"First let me address some of the other reviews. It's really not fair to penalize the TV itself for using a Roku system. You either like Roku or you don't -- it's a personal preference. Personally, I like Roku and have used it for years on all my TVs. If you haven't used Roku before, you need to understand that yes, you have to give them some personal information when you set the system up; the same way you have to do when you use cable or premium channels. If that bothers you, then don't buy the TV. Otherwise, deal with it. Same thing with the remote control. Roku's is simple, yet very functional. I prefer it that way. If you'd rather have a massive remote with a zillion buttons you'll rarely use, then don't buy this TV or use a Roku system. My only complaint with the Roku system is that the audio/visual synchronization is messed up A LOT. This has only happened on the last 2 Roku series and seems to be a very common complaint among other users. I fix it every time by simply switching channels and then going back and it fixes the problem, but, yes, it is a royal pain. I have 2 Roku sticks and 1 built-in Roku system on 3 different brands of TVs and have used these TVs in 3 different cities with 3 different internet companies and they ALL have that same problem. So by process of elimination, it is definitely a Roku issue. It doesn't really bother me that much because it's so easy to fix. The simplicity and full-function Roku system, the features, and lack of any other problems makes up for it. That said, however, fair or not, I did deduct 1/2 a star because of the sync problem.

As for the TCL TV itself, I am very, very pleased with the product. The TV arrived quickly, well-packaged, and completely undamaged, and was easy to set up since I already had a Roku account. I did have to contact Amazon when the Series 5 I ordered never arrived (turned out it was out of stock), but customer service was extremely helpful and pointed me in the direction of the Series 4. The picture and sound are great and there are many, many settings for those who like specific adjustments. The blacks are very black and I haven't experienced any of the picture loss at the corners or in the middle as some reviewers did, although I've only had the TV for less than 2 months. The TV is very heavy and solid, but will still mount safely on a wall. I bought the 75 inch, Series 4 only because, as I mentioned, the Series 5 was out of stock, but there really is very little difference between the two except they used different transistors (due to the shortage) and the Series 4 was $100 less.

"I have never heard of TCL televisions before finding this one on Amazon at 50% off. I just wanted a 4K television that was without headaches. This one is so nice. ROKU is built into it as the default, which I love. I just want to watch my streaming movies on VUDU, Netflix and whatever. Honestly, the only complaint (which may be old news) is that the internal speakers are meh. I had the option of buying the television with a sound bar, and obviously surround sound systems make the TV speakers unnecessary. I did not need any of that...I am going to watch this TV in bed with headphones. (Fun fact: listening to the TV with headphones can only be done through the ROKU mobile app...connect the app on your phone to the TV, use the ""remote control"" function, and there's a headphone button on the screen.

"My brother and I searched for a decent TV at an affordable price for my mother after she moved into a new apartment. We did a lot of research, read a lot of reviews, and decided to try this one out.

It's really good! Even after a couple of years of consistent, everyday, use. The set up is easy, even for people who don't do things like this often. The remote is pre-paired ahead of time, and while you are required to put in information into the ROKU system, you won't be charged suddenly because it's just for if you have a subscription or rent something.

The picture is clean, and the audio is crisp. Especially for a TV in this price zone. The subtitles are also really easy to read on the screen, and there isn't much (if any) delay. So I do recommend this for someone searching for a TV.

Now, the only issue I personally have is with the remote. The design is minimal. So on the right side of the remote is the volume and mute buttons, which is frustratingly easy to press when you're in the middle of a show and forgot to put down the remote. That is the only issue with the remote I have. For those curious the rest of the remote (on the front) has a power, back and then a home button. Followed by on screen navigation, and the video controls. There are also shortcuts to Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, and Sling.

Now, after a couple of years, I myself am moving into a new apartment and was looking for a TV.

"OK, first off, please read this:

This is a ROKU TV system. Yes you can use it with cable TV or with an Over The Air antenna, but it is still a Roku. And let me explain one part about Roku.

In order to use Roku, you MUST set up an account, and the reason for a payment method on file is so that if you wish to enable a Netflix or Hulu subscription (for example), the payment is automatic.

The only time you pay ANYTHING is when you either take a subscription or buy a rental. But at no time are you charged any fees.

We cut the cable cord two years ago with Roku Express+ 4K on our HD TV sets, and at that time, when I created the account, I did put my card on file, and have NEVER once been charged without my knowledge, since I DID set the account up to require a PIN. And we only rented one movie in all that time. No extra fees whatsoever.

Now, let's move on to the TV itself.

Country of Manufacture is China.
In the box you get:

TV
Two TV Stand legs with screws
6 foot Power Cord
Remote Control with two batteries. Remote is a Roku remote that is pre-paired to the TV. Even easier than the Roku 4K Express+

Quick Start guide with warranty photo registration code

Setup was quick and easy. I attached the legs, put batteries into the remote, plugged the TV in and went through the setup process. In about 15 minutes, I was watching OUR channels that we had selected, and seeing things from a whole new perspective

4K is an awesome way to start and yes, this is a starter system. Colors will brilliant and vibrant and life-like, and the set will automatically adjust to your source resolution. Some of the things I like, is that I can attach an Ethernet cord instead of using wireless and ensure a constant streaming experience, although I have tweaked our wi-fi network enough that there is no buffering.

There are THREE HDMI input ports for whatever you wish to connect to the TV as well as an HDMI ARC port if you have a sound bar setup. You also have a USB port for movies. songs and photos, an Ethernet port, a coaxial cable port for either an External Antenna or Cable TV Feed, an AV In adapter port (adapter NOT included) for older video equipment and headphone out for either Headphones or external audio equipment.

Unit comes with a 1 year warranty and you can opt to buy additional protection if you so choose. The set will upscale 1080P sources to near 4K UHD and there is also a special Roku Channel for 4K to get you started.

The set weighs 26 pounds, so if you wish to mount it to a wall mount you will want a VESA 200x300 capable mount. Those are easy enough to find here on Amazon. VESA 200x300 mount will use (4) M6x12mm screws if you already have a wall mount.

Is this a Super high end 8K or QLED or OLED TV? NO. But if you are looking to start out into 4K with something that is affordable and easy to set up, then the Class-4 series will be a good choice for you.

5 stars and two thumbs up, as well as a recommended buy from us.

I have always owned the TCL brand TVs. They are a good quality company. I haven't had any issues with this one.

No damage done. Nothing crushed nothing damaged. It was very nice. I was a bit rather very concerned when I knew after looking up the tracking where it was and how it was coming.

"First time buyer of TCL. Bought 50in. model on special sale. Price was too good to pass. TV has worked flawlessly. Initial setup was a breeze and I have not experienced any issues since but TV is connected directly to the router not through Wi-Fi so I cannot comment on Wi-Fi connectivity or speed/performance. Roku menu is easy to use. Adding streaming channels is also easy. Some reviews complain about sound quality but I find it equal to other TVs I've had (not muted or muffled but no home theather either). Remote is easy to use but sometimes TV does not respond the first time so I have to press again. Changed batteries and it got better but I think it is just the way the TV functions, you have to aim directly to the TV and press firm on the remote keys....no a big deal IMO.

"Okay so first off, the picture on this TV is really good. There's true distinction between the presets and you do not need to tinker with individual picture settings manually. Each input can have it's own preset that sticks, such as broadcast TV, Roku streaming, and console gaming. The * button on the remote is a great shortcut for changing presets on the fly based on different sources of the same input, such as whether you're streaming sports channel or a movie channel. The only awkwardness with the rather small remote, is when it comes to streaming channels you're relegated to up and down arrow buttons, as it doesn't have a numpad. You'd have to set your favorites first, then keep the channel filter set to them. Not too big a deal.

Networking strikes a Star from the review overall. [Geek Alert] - The networking hardware for wired and WiFi is truly economy level - not even midrange for a TV of this price point. Wired connections are sub-100 Mbps (averages 86 Mbps), and Wi-Fi is barely a notch over 200 Mbps on average for connection speed tests (via TV network check). Rather sub-par for a TV with 4K picture abilities, so do not set your router for a 1 Gbps or even 100 Mbps Link speed for a router wired port, or it won't connect. It has to be set to Auto if you're going with Wired connection. This is even with nothing else actively using your internet connection, such as phone or game console. [/G]

"I love the TV! The picture quality is excellent. The TV arrived packaged well, without damage. I'm not happy about the remote, however. The volume and mute buttons are on the right side, and since I am right-handed, when holding the remote, invariably I will unintentionally press the mute button, or one of the volume control buttons. It's frustrating because the buttons are placed right where I naturally hold the remote. Since it has a minimalist design, there's not much room to hold it any other way. I deducted 1 star for that reason. I'm happy with the other features of the TV, however.",B08DHFX4FV,Decent option,Size: 42 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"We replaced out 32"" unsmart tv that had an external Roku with this one and so far very pleased! It's super simple to set up and allows you to connect to cable/external antenna. Picture quality is great with very good contrast and saturation. 4k images are crisp. There are 2 things that are not as good as what i had been using: 1) watching YouTube videos, if you rewind the video a bit, it'll show you the spinning buffering wheel and then jumps back to where you had left off. So i'm watching a 13 minute video and am 2 minutes in, if i try to rewind to 1 minute, it'll go to that point but will keep the spinning wheel so you can't pause, then it'll jump back to where you left off. Not sure if this is because of the YouTube app (though it isn't happening on the other tv and the app is up-to-date), but it's a little annoying. 2) the remote feels cheap. The button clicks are very cheap-feeling and doesn't have as many features as my other Roku remote (voice command and headphone jack in the remote). Overall I'm really pleased with performance, quality, and price.

May 31,2022 - this youtube app situation is really annoying. reinstalled app multiple times & when you rewind a bit, it refuses to buffer & locks you out of pausing. then it'll play from where to rewound to and then jumps to where you rewound FROM. can never rewatch a clip",B08DHFX4FV,We save $250/month!!!!,Size: 65 inchStyle: TV Only,4.0 out of 5 stars

"Hi Everyone,

This is an excellent entry-level 4K TV at a good price with a 1-year warranty! I have been using this TV for over 3 months before writing any reviews or comments. I did a lot of research before buying a new TV and this was considered the best lower-cost 4K TV with Roku that was available. I Highly recommend this TV.

You do need to have an Internet connection and email address to register with Roku to use all the superb streaming options. You can always create a free email account just for TV stuff if you don't want to use your main email. You do not need to add a payment method (credit card or debit card, etc...) unless you want to, otherwise, just select to skip that. You can always sign up for additional streaming services, called channels, on the internet using your computer or smartphone and they will work when added to your Roku channels.

So far, I am very impressed with the picture quality, especially when streaming any of the Roku channels (streaming services), or viewing video files, or DVD + Blu-Ray discs, or through the Live TV over the air (OTA) antenna. Anything with 720p resolution or higher looks great, very nice upscaling, and anything with HDR is awesome. Even on my low speed 5 Mbps internet connection, the streaming looks really good, yet for 4K video streaming it is recommended to have a min. 15 Mbps to 25 Mbps+ internet connection.

Totally recommend using a quality surge protector or UPS (battery backup) with any electronics you care about.

I suggest running a software update in the system settings after setting up the TV for the first time, it is automatic after that. Also, this TV has a large bright LED activity light that stays on disturbing my sleep which you can disable in the settings. You can also select a default startup option like the HDMI input 1 (HDMI cable box on mine), Live TV (coax cable or antenna), or the main Roku menu (the default setting), etc...

Initially, I was disappointed with the HOA-required Comcast Xfinity cable service because the picture quality was not nearly as good as the streaming options, or when viewing video files from my media server or USB or DVD Blu-Ray discs or Live TV antenna. But, that is because the Xfinity Comcast cable DTA box is only at 480i and even the free upgraded HDMI DTA cable box is only at 720p or 1080i and the picture quality is just okay. FYI: Progressive (p) video format is better than Interlaced (i). I find that the cable box picture looks better at 720p or 1080i with the TV picture gaming setting enabled and it is still not nearly as good as 720p or 1080p from streaming channels or antenna or video files or discs. Any dark scenes using cable box HDMI are almost too dark to distinguish details, very annoying. I tried 3 HDMI cables, HDMI 2, high speed HDMI 2, and 4K HDMI 2.1 which didn't help. The coaxial connection has lower resolution, but the dark scenes look better and whatever your watching will stabilize and look better overall. The only way to get higher quality video from Xfinity Comcast cable is through their free Streaming app and your Internet service provider (ISP) or by using their free TV WiFi box which I think requires using their Xfinity Internet Service (X1 Wireless TV Box (Xi5 or Xi6) or Flex streaming TV Box (Xi5, Xi6 or XiOne).

Additional comments: I was surprised that a TV purchased in April 2022 and manufactured in January of 2022 did not have USB v3.x port(s) and HDMI v2.1 or newer ports although it does have an HDMI v2.1 audio Arc port, but not the enhanced eArc port. The HDMI Arc port can be used as a 3rd regular HDMI port if not used for audio. More ports would be really nice. This model has a 60 Hz display refresh rate with a 120 Hz CMI (Clear Motion Index); This is not a true 120 Hz display refresh rate, but I have not noticed any negative video refresh related issues except on low-quality videos or slower Internet. Note: Some new gaming systems may require an HDMI 2.1 port and an actual 120 Hz refresh rate. There is no Bluetooth either. Also, the included TCL Roku remote does not have the voice button, yet my $40 Roku Streaming Stick + remote has the voice button??? The Roku app on my Android phone does have the voice option though when connected to the TCL TV.

And, the Roku Media Player could use some major updates and or perhaps porting VLC into Roku because I noticed that some videos either through my media server or video files on USB drive would not play audio correctly because this TV cannot handle all the various video and audio formats like 7 or 8 channel audio, yet they all play well on my computers, and the video playback navigation controls may or may not work with various media servers? The Plex media server app works well. The Roku Media Player with USB drives does not seem to recognize the exFat file system either which is a common format.

Finally, I would also recommend getting an extended warranty through Amazon or through TCL.",B08GWBBH4R,You don't need to subscribe,Size: 65 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"First let me address some of the other reviews. It's really not fair to penalize the TV itself for using a Roku system. You either like Roku or you don't -- it's a personal preference. Personally, I like Roku and have used it for years on all my TVs. If you haven't used Roku before, you need to understand that yes, you have to give them some personal information when you set the system up; the same way you have to do when you use cable or premium channels. If that bothers you, then don't buy the TV. Otherwise, deal with it. Same thing with the remote control. Roku's is simple, yet very functional. I prefer it that way. If you'd rather have a massive remote with a zillion buttons you'll rarely use, then don't buy this TV or use a Roku system. My only complaint with the Roku system is that the audio/visual synchronization is messed up A LOT. This has only happened on the last 2 Roku series and seems to be a very common complaint among other users. I fix it every time by simply switching channels and then going back and it fixes the problem, but, yes, it is a royal pain. I have 2 Roku sticks and 1 built-in Roku system on 3 different brands of TVs and have used these TVs in 3 different cities with 3 different internet companies and they ALL have that same problem. So by process of elimination, it is definitely a Roku issue. It doesn't really bother me that much because it's so easy to fix. The simplicity and full-function Roku system, the features, and lack of any other problems makes up for it. That said, however, fair or not, I did deduct 1/2 a star because of the sync problem.

As for the TCL TV itself, I am very, very pleased with the product. The TV arrived quickly, well-packaged, and completely undamaged, and was easy to set up since I already had a Roku account. I did have to contact Amazon when the Series 5 I ordered never arrived (turned out it was out of stock), but customer service was extremely helpful and pointed me in the direction of the Series 4. The picture and sound are great and there are many, many settings for those who like specific adjustments. The blacks are very black and I haven't experienced any of the picture loss at the corners or in the middle as some reviewers did, although I've only had the TV for less than 2 months. The TV is very heavy and solid, but will still mount safely on a wall. I bought the 75 inch, Series 4 only because, as I mentioned, the Series 5 was out of stock, but there really is very little difference between the two except they used different transistors (due to the shortage) and the Series 4 was $100 less. Both were 2021 models. I don't do any gaming so I really can't address those issues, but everything else seems to work perfectly.

So, yes, I recommend this TV.",B08GWBBH4R,Fantastic! 2ND TCL TV,Size: 42 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars

You also have a USB port for movies. songs and photos, an Ethernet port, a coaxial cable port for either an External Antenna or Cable TV Feed, an AV In adapter port (adapter NOT included) for older video equipment and headphone out for either Headphones or external audio equipment.

Unit comes with a 1 year warranty and you can opt to buy additional protection if you so choose. The set will upscale 1080P sources to near 4K UHD and there is also a special Roku Channel for 4K to get you started.

The set weighs 26 pounds, so if you wish to mount it to a wall mount you will want a VESA 200x300 capable mount. Those are easy enough to find here on Amazon. VESA 200x300 mount will use (4) M6x12mm screws if you already have a wall mount.

Is this a Super high end 8K or QLED or OLED TV? NO. But if you are looking to start out into 4K with something that is affordable and easy to set up, then the Class-4 series will be a good choice for you.

5 stars and two thumbs up, as well as a recommended buy from us.

I have always owned the TCL brand TVs. They are a good quality company. I haven't had any issues with this one. I will tell you though that this particular one will be sent to you through the regular USPS Parcel service. I did not know that when I purchased it at the time. It came in one good piece. No damage done. Nothing crushed nothing damaged. It was very nice. I was a bit rather very concerned when I knew after looking up the tracking where it was and how it was coming. It is not in any extra box so it comes in it's own TCL Box directly from the store so take extra caution when ordering this for that matter.,B08GWBBH4R,"I've bought two, one for mom and one for me.",Size: 77 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars

"First time buyer of TCL. Bought 50in. model on special sale. Price was too good to pass. TV has worked flawlessly. Initial setup was a breeze and I have not experienced any issues since but TV is connected directly to the router not through Wi-Fi so I cannot comment on Wi-Fi connectivity or speed/performance. Roku menu is easy to use. Adding streaming channels is also easy. Some reviews complain about sound quality but I find it equal to other TVs I've had (not muted or muffled but no home theather either). Remote is easy to use but sometimes TV does not respond the first time so I have to press again. Changed batteries and it got better but I think it is just the way the TV functions, you have to aim directly to the TV and press firm on the remote keys....no a big deal IMO.

"Bought this TV for my Xbox series S,I’m not disappointed. HDR when playing games brings out the vibrant colors and the picture quality is very nice as well.

"Okay so first off, the picture on this TV is really good. There's true distinction between the presets and you do not need to tinker with individual picture settings manually. Each input can have it's own preset that sticks, such as broadcast TV, Roku streaming, and console gaming. The * button on the remote is a great shortcut for changing presets on the fly based on different sources of the same input, such as whether you're streaming sports channel or a movie channel. The only awkwardness with the rather small remote, is when it comes to streaming channels you're relegated to up and down arrow buttons, as it doesn't have a numpad. You'd have to set your favorites first, then keep the channel filter set to them. Not too big a deal.

Networking strikes a Star from the review overall. [Geek Alert] - The networking hardware for wired and WiFi is truly economy level - not even midrange for a TV of this price point. Wired connections are sub-100 Mbps (averages 86 Mbps), and Wi-Fi is barely a notch over 200 Mbps on average for connection speed tests (via TV network check). Rather sub-par for a TV with 4K picture abilities, so do not set your router for a 1 Gbps or even 100 Mbps Link speed for a router wired port, or it won't connect. It has to be set to Auto if you're going with Wired connection. This is even with nothing else actively using your internet connection, such as phone or game console. [/G]

"I love the TV! The picture quality is excellent. The TV arrived packaged well, without damage. I'm not happy about the remote, however. The volume and mute buttons are on the right side, and since I am right-handed, when holding the remote, invariably I will unintentionally press the mute button, or one of the volume control buttons. It's frustrating because the buttons are placed right where I naturally hold the remote. Since it has a minimalist design, there's not much room to hold it any other way. I deducted 1 star for that reason. I'm happy with the other features of the TV, however.",B08GWBBH4R,Decent option,Material Type: tv antenna -k12,5.0 out of 5 stars
"We replaced out 32"" unsmart tv that had an external Roku with this one and so far very pleased! It's super simple to set up and allows you to connect to cable/external antenna. Picture quality is great with very good contrast and saturation. 4k images are crisp. There are 2 things that are not as good as what i had been using: 1) watching YouTube videos, if you rewind the video a bit, it'll show you the spinning buffering wheel and then jumps back to where you had left off. So i'm watching a 13 minute video and am 2 minutes in, if i try to rewind to 1 minute, it'll go to that point but will keep the spinning wheel so you can't pause, then it'll jump back to where you left off. Not sure if this is because of the YouTube app (though it isn't happening on the other tv and the app is up-to-date), but it's a little annoying. 2) the remote feels cheap. The button clicks are very cheap-feeling and doesn't have as many features as my other Roku remote (voice command and headphone jack in the remote). Overall I'm really pleased with performance, quality, and price.

May 31,2022 - this youtube app situation is really annoying. reinstalled app multiple times & when you rewind a bit, it refuses to buffer & locks you out of pausing. then it'll play from where to rewound to and then jumps to where you rewound FROM. can never rewatch a clip",B08GWBBH4R,We save $250/month!!!!,Material Type: tv antenna -k12,5.0 out of 5 stars

"Bought this TV in October 2022. The TV is definitely NOT ready for customer use. Followed the setup instructions, and it worked fine for 30 minutes, then went completely bonkers. The entire system froze, none of the buttons on the remote or the set worked, and the indicator light started fluttering. I called TCL customer support, and a helpful technician stepped me through at least a dozen diagnostics before we were able to get it working again. About 30 minutes after the call ended, the TV went bonkers again, exactly the same as before. I called customer support and luckily got the same helpful technician. This time I asked him if he thought mine unit was defective and I just need to exchange it, or if other customers were having the same problem? He said truthfully he had gotten other calls with the same problem as my unit. I thanked him and returned the TV, bought a Samsung instead.

"My wife sent me the listing for this TV when she received it as a special sale item and even though my current old TV was still working fine, I decided that it was a good enough deal that I would upgrade to 4K finally. I liked that it had a lot of potentially beneficial connectivity between other devices, like cameras and other smart home stuff. I already had a TV wall mount from my old TV. The only problem was the mounting holes on the back of this TV were different and I didn't have the leftovers from the mounting hardware, so I had to wait until the next morning to run to the hardware store and get what I needed. After that, it was up on the wall within minutes. Another problem: the mounting of the bracket on the back on the TV is much lower than my old one, so the TV sits about 8-10"" higher than before. I will need to take down the TV and move the entire wall bracket down so it sits at the right height.

Setup is pretty easy, getting through the general stuff, the WiFi connection, updates, and scanning through the TV channels...yes, I still use antenna for a couple local channels I can't get through streaming. That all went fine. I connected my existing in-wall HDMI cable to the ARC port and set my receiver to the Roku input. I had great picture and audio. I decided that I should also try using the TV with its built-in Fire TV capabilities.

That's where things went off the rails. The ARC was working fine for all of a few minutes, and then after changing a couple unrelated settings and rebooting the TV, I had no more sound over ARC. I messed with settings on the TV and my receiver for 10-15 minutes before turning to the internet for help. I found an answer that said to unplug the TV for a few minutes and then it should work again. Great. Did that and I did indeed have sound over the ARC channel, but it would cut out every 5-7 seconds. I tried messing with all sorts of settings but eventually gave up and just connected an optical cable between the TV and receiver to get sound working properly. I might have to try a newer HDMI cable to see if that makes any difference.

With that working, I was able to use the native Fire TV apps. I've been using the native Fire TV system now for a couple months and I have to say, it needs work. When the apps work, they work. But every once in a while, and it's happening almost daily now, I'll load an app and it won't respond. I'll have to reboot the TV and then the apps will start working most of the time. Sometimes even a reboot won't work and I just have to wait for the app to eventually load. I don't think its an internet or WiFi issue, since nothing else seems to have any problems. I just think the Fire TV environment is slow. I don't know if it's because of the hardware or the software, but the instant I started using it, I could tell how much slower it was to respond to anything compared to the Roku box I have.

Needless to say, as a display, this thing works great. The picture is clear and bright, the details are amazing. I haven't played much with the picture settings, as out-of-box, it was already good. I like that it integrates the OTA TV channels right into the menu so I don't have to change the input. I also like the on-screen notifications from Alexa for specific things that I have set up. I haven't played much with the integration of the Ring doorbell and the picture-in-picture display for it. I also plugged a web camera into the USB port on the TV and it recognized it, but I haven't tried to use Zoom yet with it.

I gave it 5 stars, despite the issues with ARC, as that may not necessarily be the fault of the manufacturer, but more an issue with my cable, or the setup between the TV and my receiver...maybe they just don't work well together. I've read that Yamaha's receivers all tend to be finicky with ARC, so it may just be that. I'm also not dropping any stars, despite the speed issues, as it could potentially be related to my network, or might work fine after an update. Either way, I could use it as just a display with my Roku and it would be a 5-star display at that point. But then I'd lose any capabilities with the integrated Alexa and smart features.",B08P3QVFMK,Easy to set up and use.,Size: 40N5200,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Not very smart. With terrible support. Even though I was an audio/videophile, when I could afford it, and even though this TV is not OLED, I am extremely pleased with the TV, picture-wise (plus I got it on sale for $299,which helps expectations). The sound is acceptable, until I can augment with external speakers. I can hear it just fine and there's enough audio settings, esp voice enhancing, to set it to hear around my apt. I have it on its stand, on a table, so there's room for the sound to reflect off the table. If you wall mount it, this will not be true, so may be6much quieter. But it's much better than I thought and the sound approximates as home theater-ish as it can (not much, granted!). The preset EQ is terrible. There's no separate bass, treble, mid settings.

I have had no trouble running the TV with and casting from my 2yr old Motorola Android phone. From every streaming service app. Set up was easy, after I got the hang of a smart TV, and I easily downloaded the TV and phone apps and logged into all my streaming accounts.

I was bothered that there weren't many video settings but as of yesterday's significant software update, there's more. But if you don't want to be bothered, it's certainly acceptable set as delivered, or using the many video presets.

The bad: I can't mirror from my desktop computer to the TV. My research shows that only Intel Pentium 4th generation processors will reliably connect. I have a 3rd generation (Sandy Bridge) processor, and even though it did connect, with some issues, for about 3min, it hasn't since. While Mirrorcast, included with Windows running on a Sandy Bridge processor, may successfully mirror to your TV, it *very* well may not. This is all Wi-Fi. I have yet to try using an HDMI cable and using the TV as a 2nd monitor. Or buying a Chromecast device, which is even more money. But gamers be cautious (I am not a gamer, per se, but I would love to run my Second Life virtual world on a 50"" screen!). I have to send movies I own or home video clips, etc, to YouTube, in order to watch on the TV. This takes forever, esp if HD or UHD. Like 12+hrs to process if UHD. I need to update my DVD player but why should I have to. Why wasn't the info about the processors front and center on the sales info? I only think it's recently on the TV support page. Not sure about AMD machines and don't remember what it said about Mac, but I don't think it was good. Check it on Amazon mirroring page for this TV.

Even though I went crazy searching the internet for a cure for mirroring, most info is for a Firestck and not FireTV. Similar but not the same. The Amazon support pages are a brief joke.

I finally, before giving up mirroring, called support yesterday. I've worked support (granted, developer support) and I was shocked. I knew way more than she did, and she was obviously using the internet or a database, for the simplest of questions, which I can do! Her TV simulator had a whole different menu than the TV! And it took me 5min to convince her (how hard is ""My menu doesn't have that."" to understand?). I was hoping to escalate the call to a more technical tier, but, after a ridiculous conversation all I could get was a supervisor. The supervisor was much *more* knowledgeable, but still not the TECHNICAL support I was after. I don't want to be told, ""The software won't connect on your machine."" Which software? Why won't it work? How do you know my computer and what's on it? Plus it was a HARDWARE issue. I actually found the processor info while on hold while they Googled their answers. So I guess the call wasn't a waste... TBF, these ladies were *incredibly* patient and nice. Even called me back when the call got dropped. If you have a simple issue, they would be ok, if you can get past the things I've mentioned. English was most excellent.

I'll spare you my rant about a big company like Amazon should be able to field at least minimal support. Esp for expensive and smart products. I will never buy an big tech Amazon brand again.

Even though I am happy with the TV, only as a TV, I dinged 2 stars for terrible support, the hidden mirroring info, and the difficult software and user interface. As a former software developer, it's like it was written by 12yr old interns. It's really important that you are able to control and cast the TV from your phone, for the best experience.

There's also no way to display the time/date on the screen, without rooting the TV and running software! Even my 80s TVs and VCRs could do that, with one on/off setting, and reliably set sleep time! Setting sleep time, screensaver options, and such is broken, although I did notice that the quick sleep timer is working better since the update. Settings are very confusing. Nothing seems like it's where it should be, esp on the big gear menu from the Home screen. The remote settings overlay (from remote) is slightly better but menus arranged differently. Oh, and the teenie, tiny remote really stinks, but I have a remote control phone app which helps, although not worth it just to do volume and other simple things. Again, if not for my phone, this TV would be far less enjoyable.

As of this review, I've owned the TV for a month, with heavy use, with no malfunctions. Knock wood, and I hope it lasts as long as the 24 payments. I am a senior lady with health issues, but was able to unpack, screw on the stand, and set it up myself. It was very hard on me, but there was no one else here to do it. I was using it within 20min. Very A/V tech literate, though.

I've been watching it with glee, coming from years of having to use my 24"" 1080p computer monitor. If I had owned big modern TVs before, this might be a 1star review. It's far lower in overall quality, in every way, (granted, much cheaper) than my 90s Sony big screen TV, even with its limited resolution. Lighter and smaller, though, even though same size. Hope this helps someone!",B08P3QVFMK,TCL offers Lemons,Size: 40N5200,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I have a significant investment in Amazon Fire TV Cubes (3) and Sticks (6) and so I decided to try out the Amazon Fire TV (43 Inch Omni). This is for my master bedroom and is not my main viewing TV. I also own an LG 55 inch C6 (OLED), a 65 inch LG 9000 (IPS panel) and a 55 inch Hisense U8G (VA panel) which are fairly high end TV’s that all have above average picture quality and upscale functionality.

The Omni TV does not compare to my main TV’s in picture quality, however, the 4K picture is actually quite decent for a bedroom TV whose main viewing time is either early morning or late evening (in a darkened room). Also, we don’t have any soundbars, DVD players, or Cable boxes attached to the Omni TV. We use YouTube TV for local channels and have a number of streaming services (Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, etc.).

What I like about the Omni TV
1. Very lightweight at 15.5 pounds making it easy to mount on the wall.
2. Set up was extremely easy since I am a registered Amazon customer. Plug it in, answer a few questions the TV does a software update, linked to my saved settings for WiFi, automatically downloaded my previous applications from my Fire TV Stick and it was ready to go.
3. The interface is exactly like all my other Fire TV Sticks and Cubes, there was no learning curve. The interface is zippy and functions well. After loading 30+ applications I still had 6 GB of memory unused, which is great. I was also able to jailbreak the TV (like the Fire TV Stick) and download Kodi, Cinema HD, Downloader, IP Vanish, and several other 3rd party utilities, with no problem. All applications work great.
4. Based on the integrated voice and Fire TV capability, you don’t need to spend $50 on a FireTV Max or $100 on a Fire TV Cube and a $30 Echo Dot, making the TV an even greater value.
5. The Bluetooth remote is a nice design and easy to use. A bit of an enhancement over the base Fire TV stick remote with some controls unique to the Omni TV (like settings, channel selector, prior key, live TV key)
6. The integrated voice commands worked for the most part. Actually, this is pretty cool and should only get better over time. I do have one issue where Voice Commands such as “Turn on the TV” work just fine, but “Turn Off the TV” does not work. This is a minor issue and hopefully will get fixed with future software updates. Note: Amazon customer service could not find a resolution to this problem other than resetting my TV and wiping out all my downloaded applications/passwords. I elected to live with the problem. All other commands seem to work well.
7. The 4K picture quality is acceptable in the bedroom.
8. The price is excellent. At $300 for the 43-inch TV, it was priced appropriately for the functionality.
9. Once you get used to how to tweak the picture using the Picture Mode function (Standard, Movie, Dynamic, Custom) settings you can improve the quality of the picture a bit. For me, the Movie mode, with Picture Temp set to Warm 1 worked best for me. Compared to other TV’s the number of adjustments are very limited. However, for ease of use for most users, this is probably acceptable. I do like using voice commands to “Switch Picture Mode to Standard, Movie, Dynamic, etc.”. This saves clicking the remote button multiple times and is easier to execute.
10. Integration to my Ring Doorbell and 4 cameras around my property works great. The Omni TV supports either full screen as well as Picture in Picture and is voice-activated. “Show me the Front Yard Camera” is all that is needed to bring up the picture….very easy to do.
11. All my TP-Link KASA smart plugs can be activated via voice through the Omni TV, i.e. “Turn on the bedroom lights”., “Turn off my backyard landscape lights”, etc.
12. Drop-in works across other Echo Dots.
13. The Omni TV can participate in standard “Speaker Groups”. i.e. “Play music Upstairs” works.
14. You can control attached Sound Bars, DVD players, and Cable boxes with this TV (like the Fire TV Cube). With 4HDMI ports, you have a lot of expansion capabilities. It comes with an IR blaster that can be used for non-bluetooth devices.
15. You can attach up to two Echo Dots to this TV to improve the sound quality. In my opinion, the sound quality on this set is ok for a bedroom. Not great, but not bad either. After all, it is a bedroom!!
16. The 43 inch size is perfect for a bedroom TV. Bumping up to a 50 or 55 inch TV would have been too big for my space. Not all TV manufacturers offer this size.

What I don’t like about the Fire TV
1. The lack of Dolby Vision and HDR 10+ limits the 4K picture quality. Dolby Vision should have been included in all the TV’s and not just the 65 and 75 inch models.
2. The backlighting is very basic with direct-lit. I would have paid more to get Full Array backlighting to enhance picture quality.
3. Good HDR requires much higher NITs - I.e. brightness (like 500 to 600) to be truly effective. The Omni TV seems to top out around 325, which is not enough to make HDR details pop in a dark scene.
4. The VA Panel has poor side viewing angles (most all vendors have this problem) but in my bedroom, this was not a problem.

All in all, I would recommend this TV if you want a decent 4K picture for a bedroom, want to save some bucks, and are invested in the Amazon echo system. The price is great for what you get and you don’t need to purchase a Fire TV and Echo Dot to gain voice control with another TV brand.

For the main viewing area, I would pay more for a larger higher quality TV that supports Dolby Vision, Full Array backlighting, better-upscaling processor, and higher HDR peak brightness.

I was able to solve the voice problem of why the Omni TV's Alexa would ""Turn on the TV"" but fail to ""Turn off the TV"" (it would always go back to the home screen and never shut down). The solution was to go into the Alexa App on my Phone - Select Devices, then - Select All Devices - Find my Omni TV in the device list - Select the Omni TV then TURN OFF Two items 1) Adaptive Listening and 2) Follow up Mode. The minute I made these two changes the TV will now turn off using my voice. Many of my Echo Dots have these features turned on so I made the assumption that the Omni TV would work the same way since these features are available. That was a wrong assumption. My guess is when you have the Follow Up mode turned on, during the shut down process, Alexa gets confused and is waiting for a follow up command (so it does not shut down). In my opinion this is a software bug. I am surprised that Amazon support does not have this easy fix in their knowledge base. If you have this problem, try my fix.",B08P3QVFMK,Good ROKU TV for the price.,Size: 40N5200,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I have very mixed opinions about the Omni 43"", which I've only had for a few days now. I mainly chose this television for 2 reasons: 1) I wanted a smart TV, so I could watch OTA channels without switching inputs. And 2), I'm already invested in the Amazon ecosystem, so why wouldn't I go with a FireTV? That it's even an Amazon product has to be a plus, right?

Err, maybe. The Amazon payment option also figured into my decision. The TV arrived quickly in 3 days, although the Amazon delivery driver failed to read the warning on the box about not setting it on it's side. The setup was quick and easy, thanks to it already being registered to my Amazon account and downloading the apps I'd been using on my Fire Stick.

The picture quality leaves some to be desired, though. I'm neither an audiophile or videophile, but despite my attempts to tune the picture settings, it always looks a little cloudy and fuzzy. That's not to say that it's terrible, but it replaced one that's 10+ years older, and that cost nearly half the price, and yet I think the old one looks better. In fact, the 4K capability is about the only advantage the Omni has over my old television.

Speaking of which, the Omni version of Alexa allegedly does all these things that are not capable with a FireStick and a dumb TV. Off the top of my head, tuning the TV on/off with Alexa is one example. But I'd been doing that with a FireStick and dumb TV for several years. I can't explain it, but all these ""advantages"" already seemed available to me, with the exception of one or possibly two.

My echo dot had trouble hearing me when my dumb TV was on, so I had to yell to have it change channels or turn off the TV. This isn't a problem with the Omni and that's one of the best things about it. I've yet to use a camera with the Omni, but when I kid you not, when I asked it to display my Ring Doorbell, it said that ""cameras were not supported on this device"" or something akin to that. It later began working fine with my cameras, so I guess it just took a while to get things straight. Btw, my old dumb TV actually had a few advantages over the Omni, as well, adding to my mixed feelings here.

Finally, I want to talk about the included ""Fire Cube"", advanced Alexa implementation or whatever they call it. I was hoping to use it as a regular Echo device and move the Echo I already had into another room. The Alexa implementation was also mixed, though. It works quite well and does offer advantages over an Echo Dot, like how I previously mentioned it hearing me better with the TV turned on. But it's incomplete and more like the Alexa implementation in the FireStick remote, except that you don't have to push a button to speak to it.

For example, you can't put it in a group in the Alexa app and you can't use it in some routines. I'm still discovering the differences, but it doesn't appear that the Alexa in Omni is a viable replacement for an Echo device, which is a real shame. Furthermore, Alexa uses the same volume control as the TV, but one is always much louder. For example, if you're watching TV and ask Alexa something, you might not be able to hear her response. But if you turn up the volume to hear her, then the TV will blast your ears off. And this is just with the built-in TV speakers and normalization turned on to level the volume. There needs to be separate volumes or some sort of control for this, imo.

That's all I have for now, but I'll update this if I have anything else to add. Overall, I don't think the Omni is terrible, but it needs some work and just feels unfinished. Considering how Amazon uses Zoom to sell it, they should have included a $15 camera for free, considering the already high price for what you get.

Oh yeah, one more thing. I can't figure out any way to customize closed captioning for OTA channels. Caption customization works fine for everything else, so it's only the OTA channels. This isn't a problem for my other Smart TV, so I assume it's not a problem with OTA signals. And it's not a huge deal, but it's another example of something unfinished on the set.

I will end on a positive note, however. The reviews all say that the sound isn't very good. I happen to think it's decent for a TV in this price range. Some say that a sound bar is a requirement with this set, but I disagree. The sound is actually better than my other Smart TV and I love that it's has options for those who are hard of hearing (i.e. dialogue clarity). Ironically, one of the biggest disappointments for reviewers, has been one of the few things that I'm actually pleased with here. It's also super easy to just tell Alexa where you want the sound level.

Update: The Alexa implementation continues to impress me and I'm willing to admit that it's better than I originally thought. But it's still not a full replacement for an Echo device and it has a ways to go to get there. Right now you just can't use it in a smart home to do the things that an Echo device will do.

I've already had multiple updates and they've actually fixed some problems, but not others. And I'm still finding more, as well. This could be a great smart TV some day, but it was just released too soon and it feels too much like a beta version. Having said that, it still feels a need for me, so I'll be keeping it, while hoping to see improvements that shouldn't even be needed in a new TV. Amazon really needs to concentrate on getting hardware working right in the future.

Update II: Another disappointment: The menu navigation is surprisingly slow for a new TV. My Fire TV Stick 4K was much faster, despite being 2 years old and having little storage space left. Not to mention that it has half the memory of the Omni TV.

Update III: I have to give Amazon credit for regular updates. Most are probably for apps and the guide, but some have fixed existing problems already.

One glaring problem is the inability to choose a default profile for logging into the system, without removing profiles altogether. I have my mother on my account, so I can set everything up for her and because I want to be able to login to my profile from her TV. However, this means you need to choose a profile before Alexa will fulfill a Ring camera request, which defeats the purpose of Alexa making things easier. Surely this wouldn't be difficult to fix and it needs a fix real bad. Besides, who wants to choose a profile whenever it's unnecessary?

Update III: Seems that a recent update has made it possible to have your Ring camera alerts automatically display a live view on the Omni TV. This is why I chose this TV and I consider it a huge feature, since I don't live in the safest neighborhood. It doesn't seem to work with the original Ring Doorbell, however.

Unfortunately, recent updates have also made the sound worse. I often have to turn the volume way up to hear it now and the volume slider moves very slow.

Speaking of which, I've come to the conclusion that the biggest problem with this TV is that it sorely lacks the hardware sources it needs to function properly. The result is that menu navigation is slow and it often crashes. You'd think the opposite would be true for a television attempting to be more advanced, but nope.",B08P3QVFMK,Nice TV.

"The first one arrived with a shattered screen (see the photo on this review) and the new one arrived w/o issue. I'll speak about the return issues later in this post, but as they do not affect the quality of this TV I will leave that for later.

The TV is heavier than I would have expected, and the first one that had the shattered screen felt very cheaply made. From the feel of the new one, the screen glass is part of the structural integrity of the entire TV, which seems like it would put too much stress on the glass to me, through the glass does appear to be laminated safety glass which does give it more strength, but it is still glass (I'm basing that on the pattern of the cracks from the first TV as some of them did not ""show"" on the surface and appeared to actually be ""under"" the top layer of glass).

The picture quality is really good and I have not noticed any weakness in the blacks as I read in other web sites reviews (at least not after I adjusted the colors, contrast and brightness). I have also used it for gaming and have not noticed any issues with the ""only"" 60Hz refresh rate (I mean TV's I grew up with were less than half that and I'm not sure the naked human eye can tell the difference between 60 and 120Hz).

The sound is really weak in the bass range, but the optical output works mostly (it does not work with Netflix for some reason) with my ILive sound bar (which the remote is able to control) to add bass back in it sounds ok. I didn't try other sound profiles, so maybe there are better ones.

Alexa integration work well (this my first Alexa product so I have nothing else to compare it too) except that it doesn't seem to know my TV has a sleep timer (it tells me it is not supported even though it's right there in the menu). Not sure if that is a software or hardware issue.

I agree with most of the 3rd party reviews I read, for the price you will be hard pressed to find a better price point, but it is more like an ""entry level"" piece of hardware for someone like me that this is my 1st 4K TV, and some video aficionados may find the feature set lacking, but so far everything I have used more than meets the needs of most people that just want a good TV for a good price.

-------------------------------Returns issues below not reflected in review above------------------
Now for the issues returning the broken one. Amazon only gave me 2 options, pay for it myself or have UPS pick it up. Well I was not willing to pay the return shipping as that would probably be as much or more than I paid for the TV. UPS pickup is problematic because I have a job and can't be around all day waiting for them to show up. I tried to call UPS and schedule or at least get an idea of when they would be there, but because I didn't have the tracking number they would could not help me. I ended up having to take a day off work so I could sit home on day 3 to make sure the TV was sent back.

Then Amazon didn't think I returned the item, so I ended up getting charged again for the TV. I went back and forth with Amazon on this multiple times and in the end, I ""guess"" they refunded my money, but what they did was refund the $205 is gift cards I used, credited my credit card for the price I paid for the TV and then charged me full price for the TV (which was only $10 more than the sale price when I bought it but still), so I ended up paying full price for a TV that was on sale and I was not able to use $205 in gift cards to help pay for it. I would not have paid full price for this TV and yet that is what I ended up having to do. I won't purchase any more ""big ticket"" items from Amazon, and will be limiting my purchases here in the future. It seems Amazon has decided to no longer care about the customer anymore. Time to find a better vendor to give my business to.",B08P3QVFMK,"Great display, but needs some upgrades",Size: 40N5200,4.0 out of 5 stars
"For the price the picture is amazing, I was stunned watching in HDR, fantastic.

The problem is the horrible software. There is a big lag when using the controls especially when making changes to the picture. Calling up the picture controls can mean waiting 15-30 seconds. You start to wonder if you pressed the button. Finally the controls appear and you try moving through them. There can be a lag there too, waiting to move down the list.

Want to change the brightness or any setting with a number value that goes to 100? You need to hope you are lucky and the tv isn't laggy again because holding down a button to decrease or increase a value can mean hearing 30 clicks on screen and seeing a value change by one number. To get it unstuck click down or up one at a time, it seems to unfreeze it, then you can go quickly again.

The bad lag problem is intermittent. Turn the tv on and everything works great, then it doesn't and you have to wait forever for it to make changes.

Alexa fails. She's working great, doing whatever you need. Then you ask her to do something and the tv flat out won't respond. Unplug the tv, plug it in and start again. I have had to do the three to four times a week. Happens so often I am using a smart plug so I do not have to go over to the set.

For the price the picture quality is a steal in my opinion. The tv is light and was easy to install and I am glad it can work with Alexa. the only reason I can accept the horrible software (I didn't mention all the problems) is because I bought the tv when it was on sale and the price was very low.

My next tv I want to be OLED and I am not planning on buying Amazon brand again. By the way, this is my second Amazon brand television and I had zero problems with the first one.",B08P3QVFMK,"Better than expected picture, but",Size: 32M4500,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I've had the TV a month now, so my review comes with many hours of usage & frustration.

(This review was updated 08/28/2022 and is at the end of this one)

I bought the 55"" Omni during Prime Day because it was a great deal on Amazon's new line of TV's...but have been very disappointed with the picture quality and lack of Alexa integration with Cox Cable's Contour box.

As others have reported, the picture quality has a hazy/halo-like appearance, instead of having a crisp & sharp quality and colors. Darkened scenes, such as night or not well lit scenes are so dark, that you can't see many things, details, or faces in the picture. I've spent umpteen hours resetting, adjusting, and fidgeting with the color & image controls with little improvement. It's simply a terrible quality screen & image.

I have a 12 year old LG 47"" flatscreen TV that still has a beautiful image & color quality, much better than this Omni. I bought the Omni to replace it, but have been very disappointed and annoyed by the image & color quality.

As for the Alexa voice integration and Alexa TV remote, they work great & are very convenient for Prime Video...but they don't work at all with Cox Cable's Contour cable box, which is upsetting for a brand new TV. The odd thing is that the TV and remote identify & recognize Cox Cable and the Contour box as a device hooked to it...but Alexa won't obey voice commands, such as, 'Change to channel 52'. And the Alexa remote buttons won't control channel changing, either, although I've paired the remote to the Contour box following the on-screen prompts, as well as re-doing the steps manually, according to Amazon's instructions and support website. The only thing that works is the Mute button. I've asked Amazon support about this and they have no answers, not even wanting to admit that Alexa & Contour devices won't talk to each other.

Basically, the TV recognizes the Contour box, but won't control it. I have a feeling that Amazon deliberately doesn't want to integrate with Contour for their own reasons, but won't admit it, and falsely represents Alexa's compatibility and then wastes customers' time trying to pretend that they don't know about this when customers try to get support to resolve it. All they do is point you back to the same support website for pairing devices to the TV that you've already tried...then blame Cox when they can't get rid of you, because you're mad at spending all this money on a TV where Alexa only half-works. Cox's Contour box has been around for awhile and there's no excuse for this lack of functionality.

In the end, I'm not happy or satisfied with this TV or Amazon and would not recommend it, unless you want something cheap to use in a guest room. I'm keeping the TV because I don't want to spend more money on another brand right now, but I won't be buying Amazon's Omni TV in the future, as I replace two other TV's in the home that are getting older.

REVIEW UPDATED 08/28/2022
To Amazon's credit, their customer service dept. called & emailed me after reading this review and worked with me to understand the issues, but had no resolutions, so they offered to replace the TV under warranty. I agreed, but opted to pay the difference and upgrade to the 65"" Omni Fire TV, which I ordered.

If you can spare the extra dollars, I strongly recommend purchasing the 65"" Omni. It is very superior to the 55"" Omni in terms of build & picture quality. Out of the box, the picture was phenomenal. The TV also has a thin, yet strong silver steel frame surrounding the edges of the TV, which make it very rigid & strong. Smaller Fire TV's don't have this steel frame, so they flex when lifting or moving them.

The 65"" Omni is a huge & heavy TV that requires a lot of room and likely two people to lift & place it, if you're a mere mortal and normal-sized human. I'm neither, so I was able to heft the TV by myself, from the ground to its new home on a stand several feet off the ground.

As for the Alexa vs Cox Contour cable box issue, that magically resolved itself one night on the 65"" TV, either due to an update or some fiddling I did in the Fire TV's settings...I don't know what the magic bullet was, but Alexa can now communicate with Contour and change cable channels by voice command.

On that note, I really enjoy using Alexa to voice-control the cable TV, Prime, volume, mute, etc. It's so much more convenient than using remotes. But Amazon has to be careful about this technology, it's future iterations, and how it's used in the home, because it treads a fine line between convenience and invasion of privacy. If I ever feel their devices go too far and violate my privacy, or that I can't trust Amazon, I'll never use or buy their TV's or devices again.

In the end, I'm very happy with this 65"" Omni and glad I upgraded from the 55"" Omni. I'm also very happy with Amazon's quick response to contact me about replacing the 55"" TV and not screwing around. If I could review their customer service separately, I would. But all I could do was call & email them to thank them for their good service to make me happy.

Although I would like to change my original 2-star review to a 5-star review, because of Amazon's outstanding customer service and how great the 65"" Fire TV is, I decided to leave it 2-stars, since the original review was for the 55"" TV, not the 65"". Amazon's system won't allow me to do a separate review of the 65"" TV I purchased...it keeps throwing me back to this review to update...so I'm stuck simply adding the updated info here.

Hope this helps people who are on the fence about Fire TV's and which size to get.",B08P3QVFMK,"Very nice 4K TV for a bedroom (4 stars), 3 Stars for a main TV Viewing area",Size: 40N5200,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Pros:

Great big TV with 4 HDMI inputs - one dedicated for ARC for soundbars or speaker setups

Easy setup and customization

Fast connection speeds - i thought i had my ethernet cord in correctly but realized after three apps installed i saw that i didn’t plug it in. it was so fast with its wireless connection i didn’t realize it wasn’t wired.

Cons:

Remote pairing for cable boxes is a half days worth of searching for codes & ending up using auto search mashing a button for 20 minutes per input.

On the Fence:

Alexa - if you are all in on voice control this is the tv for you, i don’t use it personally so it’s nice that there is a physical switch on the bottom of the tv to turn that off - then you can run through the various alexa menus to turn that off or any privacy or ad serving settings - took me a half hour to undo all that, not sure the average person has the patience for that but hey maybe you can do it faster than me. This isn’t a con than more than a personal preference.

Tips:

Use the latest 4K HDMI cables you have, anything from the early 2.0 days will cause a fit in the HDMI ARC connection.

Get a stand, feet or wall mount this tv. The supplied feet are fine and work just okay but are a little low and makes remote use a bit hard if you have a sound bar.

Audio: For anyone else with an optimum cable tv box - for audio control make sure you go into the deeper audio settings of the audio settings and have it set to “other” for output control and not dolby digital - and then volume control set to variable. so wasn’t able to control volume of the tv with my cable tv remote until i put it on these settings. It took me two days to
figure this out myself - i’m putting this here to help anyone else out.",B08P3QVFMK,Mixed Bag,Size: 40N5200,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I was able to get this on prime day lighting deal. The price was unbeatable to any 55inch 4k tv in the world. If I review this product based on the price I got this for it's going to be 5 stars for sure.

Considering the regular price my two cents as below,

I wouldn't buy this as my main TV for these reasons,

1. The VA panel - As expected this TV has disappointing viewing angles. The seating arrangement should right infant of the TV to get the best out of this TV.
2. Pre calibration - out of the box white balance is way off. This can be corrected but need some extra effort to get this done.
3. Dolby vision is not included in the 55 inch which effects the 4k resolution.
4. Comparing the larger versions of the same TV - The 55 inch has less premium black plastic finish

Why I absolutely buy this as a second TV to bedroom or guest room.

1. Light weight and it was just so easy to mount on the wall.
2. Excellent contrast ratio, resulting in deep blacks in a dark room.
3. Decent reflection handling. The semi-gloss finish reduces the intensity of direct reflections.
4. 4k content is displayed perfectly, with no sub-pixel dithering.
5. Very little stutter when watching movies
6. Fantastic low input lag - Specially in the Game picture mode.
7. As an existing fire TV user it was super easy to set up the TV. All settings from my fire stick can be exported with no issues.

Over all there are similar quality TVs in the market for the same price range, but with this TV consumers get a hands free experience specially if you are in amazon eco system with an unbeatable smart features with fire TV capabilities.",B08P3QVFMK,Replace came (1st one had a shatter screen) and this one is good,Size: 32N5300,4.0 out of 5 stars
"We ordered this 75"" TV and are very pleased with our purchase. There were some reviews saying the TV is slow but we have not had that experience.
Our favorite thing about this TV is that you can tell the TV to change from hdmi 1 to antenna. Once on the antenna, you can then tell the TV to change from channel 2 to 8. It even comes with Pluto TV channels built in. I don't even have to go to the app they are included in the digital channels on the antenna.
The picture is so clear and glare is nit an issue for us anymore unlike our previous TV which seemed to have more glare on the screen.
We did do a direct ethernet connection to our modem so I cannot speak to how fast this TV is on wifi but if you can. I recommend using the ethernet port built into TV because our TV is very fast and responsive. I do not normally take the time to write a review but I just had to tell other people considering buying a smart TV our experience so you can feel better about buying this TV over some of the other smart tvs out there.
One other thing to keep in mind is if you are a prime member you get access to prime TV so between prime video, Pluto and our subscription to discovery plus app we were able to completely cut out cable or satellite and now exclusively stream our entertainment which saves us over $100 a month. So if you have any interest in streaming TV and movies on demand this is a great TV to consider.",B08P3QVFMK,"Great picture, terrible software, Alex intermittent",Size: 32N5300,4.0 out of 5 stars
"This unit replace a 55"" LG that was constantly having problems with Wi-Fi connectivity. This Fire TV redressed that as the Wi-Fi reception is great with no buffering issues whatsoever. While I can't speak to the picture quality being I'm blind, my wife said it's a step up from the LG in terms of resolution and clarity. What I really like about this TV is the Voice View screen reader capability, which enables me to access and select menu options. The speech synthesizer is decent but pronounces ""resume"" as ""revoo,"" which threw me off a bit. I still applaud Amazon for including the capability and at least considering the needs of people with disabilities, which other manufacturers don't seem to do. The hands-free control is great and I like that I'm able to use voice commands with the remote, which again has far reaching benefits for folks with disabilities who may have neuropathy and/or carpel tunnel of the fingers and hands. Alexa integration is flawless, which I'd expect from Amazon being they manufactured the TV and created both the Fire and Alexa platforms. So why not five stars, you ask?

There's no need to have to enter a pin every time you want to change a basic system setting for the TV when all you want to do is set a pin for Prime Video purchases. We have two young children, and little hands have been known to grab the remote and accidentally purchase a video or two. But if you want to set a Prime Video pin to prevent said purchases, the pin also needs to be entered for such things as changing screen resolution, changing accessibility features, and other tasks that don't have anything to do with blocking purchases. Seems this is an opportunity for Amazon to enhance user experience so the pin can be more localized to the specific task as opposed to it being a global pin to complete all tasks.

All in all, it's a fine product and it's only going to get better as the technology continues to evolve. The twenty-four month no-intrest installment plan is also great as many more folks like me with competing expenses and limited budgets will be more inclined to go with a Fire TV instead of having to shell out several hundred to more than a thousand bucks at one shot. I wish there were an option to give half stars as I give this device four and a half stars. Amazon's world domination will continue because they seem to really know what customers want while centralizing and streamlining all their content.

"When I saw this 55"" TV on Prime Day sale for $299, hands-free with Alexa, and with no-interest payments over 24 months, I just jumped on it. I've spent almost that much over time replacing lost remotes! I didn't realize how big this TV is, so I almost cancelled the order...but I'm glad I didn't. I've got it sitting on one of those sturdier metal and plastic folding tables (like a card table but rectangular), and I've plugged my Mac Mini into one of the HDMI ports so I can also use it as a computer monitor. What a difference! I can have all kinds of things I need at any given time open and placed around on the screen (see photo), and because I work in my recliner that's a good distance from the TV, I can read everything very well and get to all my open windows super-fast. Then, at night, when I'm ready to watch TV, I can sit back on the daybed that's on the opposite wall and watch it all on the big screen.

My 2014 LG soundbar works with it, but it's only got the optical port cable and cannot be controlled with Alexa. One of the Fire TV tech guys very patiently told me what I need to get if I want to upgrade my sound setup, and I went on and ordered one of the Echo Dots on sale for 19.99 because I couldn't find the one I bought before. I'll probably get a new soundbar at some point but, for now, I can certainly watch TV and listen to music using the one I have. But right now, I have to have the remote to control things that Alexa cannot control, and I keep it in a remote wrangler tied to my daybed (where I also sleep). I thought at first that the TV was just turning itself on by itself in the middle of the night, but then I realized that either I or one of my dogs was flopping over onto the remote, turning it on. That's a temporary issue because once I have an Alexa-compatible sound system set up for it, I can hang the remote on the wall and forget about it.

I've read a number of reviews of the Fire Omni TV series, and they are shown to be on the lower end, picture-wise. If I had wanted a super-duper knock-your-socks-off viewing experience for MSNBC, which is what I watch more than anything else on the TV, I would have to have spent five times as much, and why would anyone do that? Well, if you're really into the primo video experience and have the bucks, I guess you might...but this TV is perfect for me. The #1 selling point for me, other than the rock-bottom sale price, is the fact that I can control pretty much everything with my voice.

I did knock off a star for one reason and one reason only: In the Inputs setup, you can specify what type of product you have on a particular HDMI port. Soundbar, gaming console, etc., but there is no selection for ""Computer."" I want to be able to say ""Alexa, open my computer."" Now I have to say ""Alexa, open H D M I 1."" Cumbersome.

"I wouldn't have bought this at full price after reading the reviews, but I got a good prime day sale so I went for it. The quality of the image is good, with a few pretty important downsides. The contrast and darker parts of the image are pretty good, however, I feel like it could be a bit clearer without having to crank up the sharpness. After some tweaks that I found online, the picture quality is optimal. HOWEVER, a major issue of this TV is the response time --it's pretty awful. For a 4k smart tv branded under Amazon, I would expect something better. Compared to the old smart tv that I've had for several years, the response time is pretty bad. You press a button on the remote and it takes several seconds for it to respond. The image options are a bit convoluted but I got the hang of it pretty quick. A bonus for me was the Alexa integration. It's pretty cool to walk into your room and say ""Alexa, TV on"" and it powers on. At its current price point of ~$520, I'd probably hold off on this and look for something else, maybe a better well-known brand on sale. As I said before, I got this for an amazing price during the prime day, and for what I paid, its worth it, but when its not on sale, skip it.",B08P3QVFMK,Perfect for a second TV,Size: 40N5200,5.0 out of 5 stars

Quality appears to be comparable to High end TVs . i’m happy but it’s only been a week . if this hasn’t been updated in a while i’m still happy.,B08P3QVFMK,Best TV for the price... great value,Size: 32N5300,5.0 out of 5 stars
"There is nothing to dislike about this television; great picture and I haven't needed to hook up the soundbar. Downloading apps is easy and I can turn the t.v. on or off, or change the channel from any room using Alexa. I can even have the t.v. turn on or off other Alexa-enabled devices, just by talking.
Another good feature is you can see the screen even from a pretty extreme angle.
This TV has so many features that I can't begin to enumerate (mainly because I haven't used them yet), but one feature that I don't think was mentioned is the description; included in the package is an infrared cable that enables the tv to transmit to gaming console through glass, so you don't have to leave doors open if your console is behind glass doors. I don't game; but I thought this was a thoughtful touch.",B08P3QVFMK,Solid HDTV with one annoying flaw,Size: 32N5300,4.0 out of 5 stars
"25.July.2022 : I've had the TV actually plugged in and in-use for about a week. I use it mostly as a monitor for my spare PC or when my kid is using the bigger screen. I'll try to review per feature/function I've actually used :

Alexa : the Alexa integration is REALLY good. I have a mix of Google Home and Alexa throughout my house and I mostly lean Google because historically it responds better... The Alexa technology on this TV is actually responding so well that I've moved a couple of devices over to it (if you have LG Thinq products, this TV interacts REALLY well with those). It's very quick to respond and never misunderstands me. Definitely a major step up from other Alexa technology I've used.

FIRE TV: it's what you'd expect from Amazon (sadly) - all your apps and such like any other smart TV with a LOT of product and service pushing that you can't disable. I don't want to be advertised to on a TV I already paid for. Save the ads for your website. There is more space dedicated to advertising services you don't have than there is to apps you downloaded. All-in-all, even tho they limit the shortcut space for your downloaded apps to one short row (and use the other 20+ rows to advertise to you), the apps do actually run smoothly and I haven't had any errors or issues yet.

Picture/sound : the long and short of it is that the picture quality and sound are FANTASTIC. Even my PC games look great on this TV and that's saying something.

User Interface/hardware? : here's my one gripe... I have my PC set to HDMI 4. When the TV or the PC go into sleep mode, the TV seems to ""forget"" that the HDMI is connected. I'll turn the screen on and I'll wake the PC and it'll say ""HDMI 4"" but the screen will be blank (as opposed to ""no signal""). Just blank. I have to tell Alexa to switch to HDMI 1 and then issue a command to switch BACK to HDMI 4 and the picture will appear. I don't know why this happens and I've tried different sleep settings on either device, but the only way to avoid it is to keep both devices turned on all the time and that's just begging to burn them both out early. So, as it is currently, you have to navigate away from whatever input you're wanting to use and then back to it for it to work as intended. Maybe my TV is just glitchy or broken, I don't know, but that's been my experience.

"This FireTv Omni series replaced a 12-year-old Sony Bravia 40inch TV which was top of the line at the time. So all my comparisons are based on that swap.

First, the things which were noticeably better.
- Going from an HD TV to a 4K TV made a huge difference. The picture is clear. The colors are bright. Way more dynamic contrast.
- The thing weighs almost nothing compared to my old Bravia which had a full metal bezel around the whole frame. It was like lifting up a sheet of glass to hang the Omni.
- The smart TV features are nice to be integrated into the TV rather than having to use a separate Firestick.
- The WiFi is way faster. But I suppose the fact that no one uses a 12-year-old modem anymore should be an indicator of how antiquated that tech was in the old Sony.

Second, the things which are pretty much the same.
- The LED baklight is not really any different. Light and dark spots are noticeable. Nothing is pure black since it's just an LED backlit display.
- The sound routes through my sound system just fine and sounds pretty much the same. Basses and trebles are about what they were before the swap.
- Has pretty much the same number of ports for input/output. (Minus antique RCA ports which no one uses anymore.)

Third, the things which are worse than my old Bravia.
- The motion quality of this TV is not as good. It pixelates and has artifacts when fast objects move across slow objects. Shows me that the Bravia processing is superior. But for the price, this isn't terrible. But it is definitely noticeable and sometimes annoying.
- The control interface is not as flexible as my old Bravia. I can't seem to tell the TV to control my soundbar like I could with my old Sony through the ARC HDMI. Seems like something that should be pretty much standardized.
- Alexa is annoying. I turned off the voice detection so that it doesn't randomly interrupt video or audio.
- The power cord is too short if you have to plug it in to a normal outlet rather than one behind the TV. Mine barely reaches, but I can't hide it with the rest of my cords since it's off to the side and can't run down the center of the wall.
- The VESA spacing is really low. This only matters if you're swapping this TV for an old one and not changing mounts. But it is annoying, nonetheless, that I couldn't set the Omni as low as my old Sony was.

So if you don't expect 120+ frames a second for motion smoothing and don't expect a major sound improvement, this Omni is a great tv for a budget price!",B08P3QVFMK,An 'okay' 4k smart tv.,Size: 40N5200,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I have this TV in my home gym and bought it for live television. I had bad issues with SlingTV from the start. The app didn't load properly, had to be restarted, and then video playback was horrible. I did find the Fire TV GUI a bit slow on this television, so I assumed the processor was just too weak and I gave it a scathing review. I spoke with customer support and then did additional testing with Prime Video, and I even streamed a 4K video to it over my home network. Everything played back flawlessly. I feel bad for the initial bad review, seeing as how it was actually the SlingTV app. I'm used to this app on a Fire TV Stick and Roku Ultra, so I thought it would function properly on the Fire TV. I was wrong!

This television has a good picture and acceptable sound for its price range (what TV really has great sound from the small speakers?). I still find the user interface a little slow, but updates and reboots did help. Again, this is a good TV for its price range.

"I just want to say first, I got this TV for $110 during a flash sale and for that price this TV is absolutely fantastic.

Otherwise though, it's a decent TV for the price. Picture quality is decent overall, and I like the remote. I personally love the integration with alexa which while not really necessary is a nice to have.

The software is what I don't love. The fireTV software is so much more responsive than any rokuTV i've used when just moving around or typing. However the actual software itself is not my favorite. I've used quite a few different smart TV OS's and this is the worst in terms of things just being unintuitive and having things in weird places, though this is remedied partially by the fact that you can just tell alexa to start or download your app.

So as a whole I don't love fireTV OS, but other than that this is a nice TV and alexa makes up for some of the inconveniences of the software.",B08P3QVFMK,LOVE THIS TV!,Size: 40N5200,5.0 out of 5 stars

As I went through the set up and went to settings, add equipment, the tv will only recognize ATT, Directv and another! After talking with tech support they said I had to purchase the Fire Cube in order for it to work with my cable company. With no luck the cube does nothing to change Alexa controlling the Xfinity cable box!! The tech support for Amazon nor Xfinity had no clue as to what I should do!

"I bought this tv as a birthday gift for my wife....and she loves it! I love it too! We actually have our tv's mounted side-by-side in our room (because we game together).

But once we put this Amazon Fire 50"" Omni up there.....I was blown away!!!! My QLED costed me around $1200 a few years ago. This Omni, which is considered a ''budget tv'' and the picture quality is not far behind! (in my opinion).
You can also talk to Alexa w/o having to talk into a stupid remote! lol.

- It's often slow to respond to the remote or Alexa commands
- Alexa itself stops listening every now and then. I'm forced to press the Alexa button on the remote to wake it up.
- Can't always use Alexa for screen prompts in apps, for example, skip intro in Netflix or HBO.
- Can't issue an Alexa command and use the remote at the same time.

It also annoys me to have Disney and Hulu buttons etc on the remote control. Completely. waste for me if I don't have them and wverytime I look at the remote it annoys me.

The picture is crisp, clear, and has more memory for the apps. I shopped around for weeks, and this is the best price for a 65-inch 4k I have come across with the features it has.

The alexa integration is fine when it works. i never really use this because it takes a few seconds to recognize my voice and realizes i’m saying something to it. I find myself repeating myself when using the Alexa voice commands so i don’t really bother anymore. Another big thing about this TV is that the apps do not close when you hit the home button, you have to manually close out of the app for it to stop. For example if you’re watching a YouTube video and you click the home button, the youtube application will still be running in the background until you click it again and it will resume. you might think this is useful but due to this, the TV gets laggy and unresponsive like scrolling through the tiles gets laggy or turning up the volume takes a few seconds to register. in my opinion, the unresponsiveness and lag from the tv is a dealbreaker.",B08P3QVFMK,Compatible issues.

The only ""Alexa integration"" is you can use other Alexa devices as a remote control. But it has its own microphone so they don't actually do anything. IT IS NOT INTEGRATED WITH ANYTHING BUT ITSELF.
Another BAD audio problem: if I connect to my amplifier with an output cable, I can't use the TV speakers. So if I want to use the TV speakers, I have to PHYSICALLY UNPLUG the output cable from the TV. Why can't I just say ""Alexa, use internal speakers?"" GoogleTVs can use multiple Nest speakers AND remain connected to Google Home. Didn't Amazon invent this stuff?
In fact, I'd have to say ""Echo, use internal speakers,"" because it has a more sensitive microphone. I can be in the next room and say to a nearby Dot, ""Alexa, weather,"" and the FireTV switches from the last 45 seconds of the game to the weather app, I get yelled at, and I don't even get the weather report from the Echo Dot.

Using tivimate or kodi whatever you want to watch loads really fast, much faster than the 4k fire stick on the Sony. The Alexa feature works well for searching or even saying hey fire up a sleep timer for 30 minutes. All in all it's a great buy and have no real issues with it. Tweak the picture settings to your liking and you'll enjoy it. I have all the picture aids off like smoothing and everything. The sound is also impressive for just TV speakers.

My only complaint is the ups man who was acting shifty on giving me my tv said no one was home the first time when he tried to leave it and said he left a slip my mom watched him look at her and drive off then he tried to do the same thing with my husband the next day it didn't work cuz my husband stopped his truck and then he looked sad when he had to unload it so I don't know if he was just being lazy or trying to steal it by saying it got lost on its way back to amazon since ups only tries to deliver twice before sending it back. So make sure someone's home watching for it cuz some ppl r dishonest. It comes in a fire tv marked box so there's no guessing what's in it. Altogether I love the tv so far packaging removal wasn't a Hassel, set up is normal if you already have smart devices in your home like I do then setting up is even easier since you can link it to your other amazon devices.

You didn't spend 1000 on a large tv u got a cheap 55 inch and as such I do give it five stars because price is on point, you can control the device using your voice without a remote, image is good, it's very responsive and not slow on load so you get what you pay for if you want to complain about little things get a more expensive tv.",B08P3QVFMK,"The TV is good for the price, if you have a bigger budget definitely get a better TV.",Size: 32N5300,5.0 out of 5 stars

"Replaced my 65"" OLED B7a from 2017 with a 77"" C2 and I've been running it for a week as of now. The picture quality after calibration has improved over the older model. I feel the black levels on this device are far far better than the B7a ever were, which BTW required a lot of ""tinkering"" to get to what the C2 did pretty much out of the box. My old OLED had no burn-in that I could see, even after 5 years of daily usage, but the older OLED panel was never as uniform in solid colors test as this panel is, not even when the B7a was new. Especially watching dark scenes now, there is no fixed pattern noise anymore.

The scene motion on this TV is better what the B7a has, which was already good, but it had issues with some stuttering under certain conditions. Obviously this TV is 120hz with a 5 year newer video processing unit, so it would be expected to be a good improvement.

The worst part for me during initial setup was figuring out the new WebOS UI. Coming from the older B7a WebOS, which had things in different places and required different steps to get things done was quite frustrating at first. I guess once you understand how it works its okay.

After setting the TV like I wanted, I then updated the firmware and after the firmware update things didn't work right, things like LG channels got stuck, couldn't click out of some popups, etc, so I had to perform a factory reset, and redo the whole setup again. The TV has been running well since. So be aware that if you perform a hardware reset, chances are you might have to do a factory reset and redo all the settings.

The remote internal accelerometer wasn't calibrated somehow when I first paired it, so the pointer kept always pulling to the left on the screen. To resolve this I had to shake the remote several times until it finally became accurate. The scroll wheel feels a bit too deep this time compared to the previous magic remote from the B7a, which was way too high... guess the next TV will be at the sweet spot! :)

IMO. For the price of this TV I would've liked some backlight on the remote too. I did miss not having a pause button on the remote like the B7a. Which was nice to pause shows without having to bring the menu and click on the pause screen button.

Connectivity for DLNA worked well, the NAS and other storage stuff in my LAN was detected fine after everything was setup correctly.

Mobile screen cast via Miracast, etc... worked well with all my phones/tablets that are capable of screen cast.

All the basic streaming services I've tried worked well too.

Audio from the default speakers is certainly okay for a TV, and it seems to have improved the spatial audio somehow over the older B7a. Still no match for a dedicated receiver/speakers setup, but if you don't have one, this TV alone will be a good start.

Privacy was and is still a concern for me with this TV. And let me say it loud and clear: Serving ads on a 2500 dollar TV feels quite a bit of an insult, TBF; b/c at that point why not just give the TV away for free? if you are going to soak the end user in ads, and sell their usage stats, etc at some good $$$?
I believe most of the tracking, etc can be disabled by going into the agreements and disabling all the options there. For most of the basic B7a level of functionality that I wanted I only had to agree with the two first terms, so voice and all other terms are not enabled, which still is a bit of a concern to trust if a company will honor a checkbox... Also, the remote seems to have a built-in microphone, so if you are super concerned about this thing eavesdropping then you can just take the batteries out of the remote, or use an universal remote but you lose the nice mouse-like pointer. The old B7a remote doesn't seem to offer full functionality with the C2, at least not the mouse pointer part.

Overall the TV was a step up from the B7a, both in size and picture quality. Only time will tell how the TV pans out in the end, but if the B7a was an indication, working well for 5 years, I think this TV should last at least the same amount of time.",B09RMSPSK1,Great TV for the price,Size: 32 inches,5.0 out of 5 stars
"First week impression: visually stunning with some annoying quirks as a computer monitor.

I purchased this to replace an aging Seiki SM40UNP. I use it exclusively as a computer monitor, both for work and gaming. Visually the LG is in a different league than the Seiki. Colors are more vivid, it's much brighter, and blacks are like a portal to the endless void. These differences were apparent before enabling HDR, and then HDR bumped up the colors and brightness even further. During HDR calibration I flinched and cursed to an empty room when it switched from black to white; it was blinding. For gaming this is good stuff. I played some games with native HDR and some games with Windows Auto HDR. I ended up disabling Auto HDR because I thought it made some games look over-saturated, but that's probably just personal preference. Native HDR looks great.

The same visual fidelity that's great for games is a little overwhelming when using the monitor as a workstation, particularly when reading black text on a white background. Even after cranking the SDR brightness in Windows down to its lowest level, I can feel eye strain starting after just an hour of reading text. Some people have suggested that this has more to do with Windows' HDR implementation than the monitor itself; I don't know. Whatever the cause, I prefer the drab presentation of the Seiki monitor for reading/editing text. I'm typing this review on an old LCD monitor because it's more comfortable than doing it on the LG.

OLED protection features are also a bit annoying at times. E.g. if the TV detects that the input it's showing is mostly unchanging, it will slowly dim the screen. Unfortunately, typing into a dark-themed text editor seems to count as ""mostly unchanging"". Every 10 minutes or so I need to grab a bright window and shake it to wake the monitor from its apparent stupor. It's like trying to keep a tired puppy awake. I disabled other features like logo dimming that seemed to be causing problems, so this whole-screen dimming is the only one that continues to irk me. I also voluntarily use a black wallpaper and configure the Windows taskbar to auto-hide to protect the panel from burn-in; make sure you know what you're getting into if you're going OLED for the first time.

The most significant weakness of this TV is that it is... well, a TV. It's a bad sign when you have to use a remote control to agree to a privacy policy before using a computer monitor. It's not plug-and-play, it's plug-and-read-reddit-thread-and-modify-dozens-of-settings-and-play. After spending a couple hours researching and fiddling with settings there are still some things I'm not happy with. For instance, the TV doesn't enter standby the way purpose-built computer monitors do. When the computer stops sending a signal the TV takes over and shows vibrant wallpapers for a while before turning off completely, such that you have to turn on the TV again separately from waking up the computer. Maybe there's a setting to change this - if there is, I may never find it.

The final quirk is a graininess most noticeable in uniform blocks of grayish colors, which unfortunately feature prominently in many dark-themed applications. It appears to be caused by slight variation in pixel color. The grain is visible at a viewing distance of 24 inches / 60 cm, but IMO it's only distracting if you're closer than 18 inches / 45 cm.",B09RMSPSK1,Actually really good,Size: 32 inches,5.0 out of 5 stars
"This 77” LG C2 OLED TV is absolutely breathtaking. This is the best picture quality I’ve personally ever seen and it actually exceeded my expectations. Of course you get stunning contrast, colors, and crisp 4K scenes, but I want to call out some lesser mentioned features that I’ve already come to love.

- Magic remote: the Nintendo WII style cursor that allows you to navigate all apps either through traditional remote buttons or via the aim and click method is great - providing a new way of doing things but allowing you to still use traditional buttons. Also allows for equipment control to control my Samsung sound bar.
- WebOS: unlike my older LG tv, now all my streaming apps are native to tv. I get to ditch the Fire tv cube for paramount plus and HBO max
- Alexa integration works nicely
- Game mode, presets like FPS, RPG etc make switching for each game super easy. Already this tv has given an upper edge in FPS games.
- Sound- for some reason all sound is crisper
- Airplay: iOS screen mirroring and airplay work great, as well as screen mirroring from my MacBook Pro. I didn’t realize this was a feature.

Only downside so far is the Picture in Picture / split screen not working (seen other reviewers having same experience). It would be great to be able to play a game and have Netflix in a PIP window.

"Where to start? Beautiful picture 4k and SD, outstanding sound, well thought out design. It's all that and more. However, a diagram of the inputs and outputs would be REAL handy, especially when trying to plug things in, And just what do you do with the little plastic pieces (finally found in the one page instruction sheet). And the same goes for the, what I assume to be, IR blasters? Since it is set up for the PC that gloriously melted down when I attached it to the monitor (I should point out that the Alienware died while the Pi 4 8GB and little NUC never had a problem with it), I can not say how it looks for gaming and will be moving it and taking photos of the port connections and label them in the photo for future reference. I also found it to be a royal pain to find anything on LG's website. I still haven't registered it because my model does not exist yet. I hate time paradoxes! Okay, fine let's look for any manuals. Oh. I see. searching support gives an article Google Stadia issues, and another that tries to sell me one. Not holding out hopes for any support, at least for a while. It really makes me wonder if the fire sale pricing is a way to get rid of stock...

In short, don't buy unless you are techy, geeky, or know someone who is, and treat then we because they will be your support for this beautiful monitor.

"#1 son installed the TV following the directions provided, connecting the cable and Blu-ray player was simple. One remote included. Cable remotes can turn set on or off but can’t move through the menu, need the Lg remote for that and signing into apps.

I watch NHL, MLB and NFL games with no picture problems. I don’t play video games. Have dozens of DVDs, some old, and so far no problem playing them using it’s remote. Great bright picture from any angle, some older TV shows & movies automatically show in old formats that don’t fill the screen. Internet ready, but it has an app for the ones I use and no info on what else I could do with it.

This TV, like so many devices now, does not come with even a basic instruction booklet on how to use all the features, so stumbling your way around is required to set up your Disney+ or Netflix, or what the unmarked colored buttons are for, etc. For all I know it may cook my dinner but I’ll never find that feature!

I would love to tell you that this tv is great. It looks awesome at the Best Buy that i saw it at. But I will continue to have to wait to get my hands on this tv. Their attempt to deliver this tv failed on epic proportions. My wife and I were here waiting all day for this tv. I left my phone in the bedroom while I took a quick shower. They called my phone while I was in the shower and did not bother to knock on the door. They said no one was home and rescheduled the delivery. I called the number back 4 minutes after they called; for them to tell me there was no way to get a hold of the driver and I would have to reschedule. The delivery truck comes from somewhere in Houston TX and I live in college station tx which about 2-2.5 hours depending on traffic. They were in my drive way and because I didn’t answer my phone they are going to reschedule a delivery that it over a hundred miles away simply because they did not knock on the door.

"Coming from a Acer Predator 34 inch curved monitor, the size increase of this monitor isn't a shock. The width is similar, but there is more vertical height for sure. I will say that for a monitor sitting on a desk, 42 inches is about the limit for me. Any larger and you are turning your head too much.

I also recommend a monitor arm so you can move this around easily. So often in the past I have done without it and once you get an arm, you wont want to deal with something sitting on your desk. Especially a 42 inch monitor or tv.

It's a great OLED display with plenty of brightness. It supports G-Sync / FreeSync and variable refresh rate (VRR) @ 120hz. It has inky blacks as all good OLED screens do. The auto white balance is not too annoying for PC use in my opinion.

Since its a 4k screen, I do organize windows in all 4 corners of the display for work and I am sure that we will see a small amount of image retention eventually. Time will tell. I haven't turned off any of the self protecting features of the TV and don't plan to. Nothing annoying to report as a result. There is also a pixel cleaning feature that runs as needed already if this works similar to C1 models.

It really is one of the best displays I have ever used both in terms of color, black levels, response time, and clarity. Hard to beat and in many cases an equivalent LCD monitor that is anywhere near this in quality would cost much much more.",B09RMSPSK1,"If you want a crisp, bright, beautiful screen with very good sound, this is for you!!",Size: 43-Inch,5.0 out of 5 stars

"8/14/22 update: LG got the parts out fairly quickly and a local electronics company did the repair in less than an hour. They replaced the screen, not a board.

I reiterate that the TV itself is a 5 — it’s got a fantastic picture and I have 30+ years of broadcast TV production experience so I know what I’m talking about.

But I’m only updating my rating to 4/5 instead of 5/5 because of LG’s service process.

When I opened the original repair ticket, LG automatically provided troubleshooting recommendations. I had already followed the instructions that are available online and told them so. However, there’s no ability to attach a picture to the ticket and they automatically close the original ticket and then ask you to open a new ticket with all of the same information that was provided previously in case troubleshooting doesn’t fix the problem.

Once the second ticket was entered LG eventually asked for a picture but then they didn’t make it available to the repair facility so they asked for a picture as well.

Start to finish, time to repair completion was about a week and the TV was not completely down during this time. But I think LG’s repair ticket workflow needs some tweaks

Original review:
Would have rated this 5 stars as it's a fantastic TV but yesterday a thin line developed top to bottom about 1/3 of the way in from the right edge.

"This is my second LG and third led flat screen. The screen here is incredibly thin (at least at the top) and the whole unit was much lighter than my previous 65 inch. That made it easy to mount by myself. The picture is beautiful and because I have shades on all the windows of my TV room the brightness is more than adequate (knew OLEDs can have a brightness problem but this model--and the next higher--have been reviewed as quite good in the brightness area.) Because I had an LG previously, I am quite familiar with the controls and the options although the OS in much updated from my previous unit, but that is part of why I bought new. Now I can do any and all streaming directly from the TV without needing to go through my cable service and/or a Fire cube as I was doing. It is also very convenient that the TV controls the on/off of the new AV receiver I also just bought (down to only two remotes!). The only difficulty I had in getting everything setup was to get the lip sync correct which ended up requiring that I bypass any corrections from both the TV and Receiver.

"Purchased this to try out as e replacement for other antennas on two different TV's Certainly more attractive than the 12 inch square white plastiic antennas hanging from my windows. First tried it on the largest and newest flat screen TV - not so good. Old window antenna picked up better signals. Tried on the other smaller flat screen TV and had to spend 20 minutes walking the antenna around the room trying to get acceptable reception and then needed to use my own velcro strips to mount it on the wall.
Was hoping for more channels and better picture - but no improvement.
If you do not have any TV antenna -and trying to save some money from cable TV charges , might be worth a try. I picked up maybe 10 channels with his one (about the same as older ones), but don't expect much.

"This is a great book written by a truly intellectual genius of his own rank. Often, Theophile Obenga is regarded as a second fiddle to Cheikh Anta who was really an enormous multi-disciplinary master. But Obenga is also a great intellectual with an immense array of knowledge in linguistics, philosophy, history and pure science. The most important aspect of this book is the direct connection that the author establishes with the Egyptian philosophical concepts and the reader. One is able to analyze and judge from one's own appreciation the wealth of knowledge of that civilization as well as understanding the different social paradigm of that ancient society. Many Egyptologists treat that civilization from a purely materialistic aspect without truly engaging into the analysis of Kemetic social interractions. Obenga, while skimming the cultural, religious, and political structures of ancient Egypt manage as well to enter the most important element of that society and of any society: The people, the common people!
The understanding of a people is more important than the superficial theoretical interpretation of intellectuals for it is the people, the citizenry, that define a Nation. Egypt therefore, through the eyes of Obenga become more of a Human society with its crisis and problems as well as the attempt by "" individuals"" and "" leadership"" to fix those problems. That to me was the most important appeal about this book.
One fact that I learned about this book is that Egypt was clearly a conservative elitist society with the priesthood headed by the King at the helm and in control. From my personal understanding, the decline of Egypt was probably due to its own inability to foresee the winds of change and implement reforms that could have provided more Liberty to the mass. The Pharaoh and its bureaucracy was clearly benefiting from productivity of the laboring classes through direct taxation and price fixing. Had the Kings enabled the development of a private economy freed from State interference, the innovative sciences of the elite priesthood would have found practical uses in the daily life and armed with Nation with means for future challenges. I think that after 3500 years of toiling for the glory of the Amun's Son, the Fari, the people of Egypt just got tired of supporting their leaders and did not resist hard enough the invasions of foreign barbarians. Had these ingenius people been allowed to keep for themselves the fruits of their labors, I am certain that they would have fought much harder to push back the violent Eastern barbarians. This understanding, while quite imperfect can be applied to the current situation of the African people TODAY! The continent is clearly rich and blessed with a young dynamic population vying to improve its life. But, self centered African leadership does not understand that individual Freedom and private property as well as the reduction of a cumbersome bureaucracy are the central tenet for a prosperous and patriotic citizenry willing to die for its "" country"" when under attack. Individual freedom and the ability by a people to reap the fruit of their Labor is therefore central for the development of the continent of Africa. The central tenets of the "" MA'AT"" are much more richer for the appreciation of individual Liberty and private ownership! Let's therefore understand the past in order to avoid the errors of the ancient and build a future established on a better and improved foundation.",B0BFDJQ69H,Cool idea,Size: 43-Inch,5.0 out of 5 stars

"Final Update, I Hope : ) Resolution For WIFI Not Working Or For WIFI Cutting In And Out:

After updating software, resetting the tv, network settings, and infinity router more than 10 times each, trying to get this to work, and doing other things, like unplugging power for 60 seconds, and holding power button down at the tv, and NOTHING worked. I found an amazon review, where they talked about how these tvs have issues because they were programmed or whatever in another country; they said the factory reset worked for them.

Anyways, throughout all my troubleshooting, I finally got wifi to work, but it would just cut on/off and wouldn’t stay connected. BTW, it worked just fine with ethernet cable, after an initial problem getting it to work, at the beginning. Anyway, I work in computer support and am very stubborn when it comes to tech stuff, I just have to figure it out.

I had seen other people talk about resetting the tv through a special hidden service menu, and I did that many times as well, but nothing worked. Anyway, while looking at the special service menu, I thought I would try something, to see if I can get this tv “unstuck” from whatever country it was programmed in... I did the following steps.

-Turned off tv
-Then push Mute, then press 1, then press 8, then press 2 on the remote (make sure the red power light at the bottom of tv blinks each time you push each button, so you know it is taking input)
-Then I powered on tv
-It takes more than a few seconds for the special menu to pop up, and lets you select entries (see screenshots to see what service menu looks like and setting changes I made)
-I selected OPTION, then went down to MRT OPTION, then selected Region, and changed it to KOR (all this will be done with the arrow buttons on remote, the middle button and return button)
-Also, under MRT OPTION, I went to NETWORK SUPPORT, and set it to wifi_int_only (I don’t know if this helped but I figured if I set to wifi only, that it might also help get it “unstuck”)
-I powered off tv, and then back on and checked wifi settings, and of course it wouldn’t pickup anything because it was set to wrong REGION
-I powered off tv, and pressed the MUTE, 1, 8, 2
-Went back in and changed REGION back to USA and NETWORK SUPPORT back to wifi_int
-I powered off tv and back on, and mine picked up my wifi right away; if yours doesn’t just go in and set to wifi and all should work

***BTW, IF YOU ARE LIKE ME, AND TURN OFF YOUR WIFI ROUTER AT NIGHT, MAKE SURE TO TURN IT ON AND LET IT GET ITS CONNECTION, BEFORE TURNING ON TV, OR ELSE, YOU MAY HAVE TO GO THROUGH STEPS ABOVE AGAIN, SETTING REGION TO KOR, ETC! IT'S HAPPENED TO ME TWICE, SO I JUST TURN ON ROUTER, LET IT GET ITS CONNECTION AND THEN TV WORKS SMOOTHLY***

2nd UPDATE:
Well after more than a handful of tv and router resets, I got ethernet to work and it seems remote works better, but still is unresponsive at times. I need this to work on wifi because it is for my other room, which doesn't have ethernet access, but haven't had any luck. Right now I have it on ethernet in my living room, and I have my computer on wifi and all works good, except some remote response issues... Will be sending this one back, was able to recover box because trash crew hadn't picked it up. I ordered a toshiba smart tv, hope this one works a lot better.

Initial Review: Everything Looks Good But Works Horribly
I was able to setup it up and all looks ok as far as sound and picture, but on this second day, it started having connection issues with wifi. I have my computer connected via hdmi, connected via ethernet, not wifi and everything works good, but not when I switch it to smart tv, it's horrible and the remote is HORRIFIC, you push the buttons and it isn't responsive, and you have to keep pushing before it responds. I even changed batteries and it still sucks at responding. WELL, with wifi issues I'm having, I reset the tv to factory and started again, but no luck, it keeps having issues. I tried with my ethernet and no luck. I know my internet connection is good, for like I said, when I switch source to my computer, which is connected to ethernet, all works good. Will keep trying, it sucks because yesterday when all was working good, I threw away the box.",B07CL4GLQW,Scholarship in this publication goes beyond the norm.

Navigate to the top of the screen and ""search"". Type in Roku and install. As easy as that. All the free Roku channels, easy peasy.

It has a crisp clear picture. Would not work well sitting on the floor but is great with the bottom 5 feet from the floor in my bedroom. It is obviously made to be viewed from straight ahead or below the television. The range of view is not as good as I expected. The picture sharpness and clarity is diminished when your head is a foot or more above the TV.
The sound is good but the speakers are directed straight down which makes the sound travel through the wall more than my old TV. I have to reduce the volume to prevent others from hearing it outside my bedroom.

A final note: It does not play well with external Roku devices. I hooked up my Roku to the HDMI prior to learning I could install the Roku app on the television itself. When I powered the TV off and came back a half hour later I missed 30 minutes of the movie. The Roku kept streaming, did not power off with the television. It was a connected device, and would turn the television on when the home button pressed. If you need to view paid content on Roku this would not be the television for you. Paid content on this device has to be done through Samsung TV Plus.",B07CL4GLQW,A GOOD READ,Size: 50 inchesStyle: Google TV,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought this as a computer monitor for my Windows 10 PC and the image is excellent! However, here is a longer-than-necessary note about a BIG negative experience I initially had, thinking (mistakenly) that it was the fault of this TV. Several days ago I was shocked to discover that whenever a typical alert happened on the computer such as ""printer out of paper,"" etc., there wasn't just a little chime that emanated from the TV, but an ear-splitting blast of sound! I've never experienced this before. My ears actually hurt from the sound blast. Looking for a solution online, my search brought up the ""best"" suggestion which was to go to Settings > Sound > Expert Settings > Sound Feedback > OFF. But... that did NOT shut it off. Then, when I hit the MUTE button to temporarily eliminate the problem, there was an annoying SPEAKER SLASH icon that continual flashed on the screen. Now, here comes my confession of folly, my big ""duh moment."" I finally checked the settings on my faithful PC and realized that, for some reason, my PC's audio setting had jumped to 100%. I'm so glad I checked this because it had never been a problem with my previous monitor -- a 70"" Vizio that had to be replaced because of dying pixels that were creating large dark shadows. SO... after adjusting the PC's audio settings, all is now PERFECT. It's odd because I never tampered with the PC's audio settings. Therefore, if you have this same problem of ear-splitting noise explosions erupting from your Samsung TV, maybe this story will provide your solution.",B07CL4GLQW,MASTER PIECE,Size: 55 inchesStyle: Google TV,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought this TV for our travel trailer. It was easy enough to mount and hook up, but that’s where ease ended. I spent an hour trying to get the thing set up with their app and with the remote. After an hour, honestly, I ran out of time and said screw it. I’ll fool with it another time. I’ve always loved Samsung TVs - this is my fourth one - but I’ll rethink the purchase next time. I’m not sure what Samsung’s thinking with all of this nonsense, but I’m really pretty unhappy with their setup protocol now. And before anyone says anything, I’m the tech person for our whole family. Any of them can tell you if anyone can figure this stuff out, it’s me. So if I’m having this kind of trouble, I can’t imagine what a less tech-able person would do.",B07CL4GLQW,Theophiile Obenga Is A Great Teacher,Size: 55 inchesStyle: Google TV,5.0 out of 5 stars
"This tv has a good quality picture if you are looking for full HD. I was glad to find it because I don't like the look of 4K tv pictures. Too much detail doesn't leave enough to the imagination and makes everything look fake somehow.

My problem with this tv was there wasn't any setting for changing the resolution down or up. And the output to a sound bar disable the TV;s sound control. I had to use the sound bar control to change the volume.

Maybe a better quality sound bar would link up to it better, but the one I bought with it had to be returned because it only worked for about 10 minutes. It was another Samsung product that sounded great for 10 minutes, but then refused to power back on. Maybe it got dropped in the mail and something came loose inside.

The viewing angel on the tv is good and the tv itself has pretty good sound, but lacked bass. That is why I bought a sound bar, because it had a remote wireless subwoofer. But that didn't work out.",B07CL4GLQW,FINALLY FIXED WIFI ISSUES: Resolution For WIFI Not Working Or For WIFI Cutting In And Out,Size: 65 inchesStyle: Google TV,4.0 out of 5 stars

"Samsung products are certainly a notch above the rest. The remote actually has a numerical pad and not just a directional layout centered by an okay button.

It also comes on almost immediately after hitting the power button with no long delays while wondering if your command was received.

"I am very happy and impressed with this TV. We have been using ours for a few months in the kitchen area, and it has performed flawlessly.

The picture quality is great! It is sharp, bright, and very natural looking. I think the 1080P feature helps too, and is worth the slightly higher cost of this TV over comparable models. But a great picture requires a little extra initial work. When setting up any TV, you'll find that there are many picture adjustment options; some are on/off, some are selections, and some are ranges. Yes, it's a little tedious, but take the time to go through each option and set it to what looks good for you. The effort is totally worth the enhanced enjoyment of your TV viewing.

The sound quality of this TV is also excellent for its size. Conversations are crisp, music is pleasant, and the volume can go up much higher than I would ever want. Remember that you are listening to the built-in speakers of a relatively small television, so don't expect the same sound quality as you get from your Dolby 5.1 surround-sound entertainment system!

Other reviewers have complained about WiFi connectivity problems (connections lost), but we have not had this problem. Perhaps it's a function of signal strength or modem brand?

"Good choice for use in a spare room or bedroom. built in speakers audio quality could be better. If you don't opt in on the Smart TV features and data collection you are constantly annoyed with a pop up on power on or exiting from different programming options encouraging you to turn on the Smart features. Why would you not want to turn on Smart features? Perhaps like me you do not want to share your TV usage data with Samsung and 3rd party affiliates. Even with Smart features disabled when you have connected to your home network via Ethernet cable or WiFi you can access shared hard drives on devices attached to your home network. I did not have to enter the userid and password Windows 10 usually requires to access these shared devices between Windows computers. Was able to access the external drive attached to my home router without entering a userid and password, not sure how this magic is happening. May be a security concern for some. The dismal audio quality from the built in speakers reminds me of what I heard watching my parents 1964 vintage Zenith 19 inch black & white TV. Audio quality might improve if you use a soundbar. Was hoping to test it with a pair of good quality amplified computer speakers however the only audio output options are an optical cable or HDMI ARC connection. No Bluetooth. HDMI cable not included with TV. Only cable included is the power cable. Remote control is easy to use and includes numerics making it easy to select off the air channels. Was able to easily configure the remote for my DIRECTV Satellite receiver to control TV power on/off and volume. When turned off a RED LED is illuminated on the bottom right of the TV bezel which may be annoying to some insomniacs.",B07CL4GLQW,Great picture color,Size: 48-Inch,5.0 out of 5 stars
"It is four stars only because you need an additional gadget to set up bluetooth. The rest is top-notch.
I have this TV for couple weeks and love the picture quality, the size of TV, and the price. Being Samsung TV, it has tons of Samsung TV channels, plus I use smart TV apps, and a few local TV channels I receive with a small indoors antenna (I have no cable TV subscription).
It took to time to set it up, Wi-Fi connection did not work and I use ethernet, but I guess it is caused by the router being in another room.

I am close to illiterate in tech gadgets and I am not paid to promote other Amazon products.
I like to use headphones, but this TV has no bluetooth in it. If you go to TV settings - sound, it says something like HDMI-ARC. After googling all these mysterious words and reading answers about this TV, I bought ""HDMI ARC Adapter Audio Converter""
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0791CFGY1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1
I already had (also bought on Amazon) bluetooth transmitter receiver, and bluetooth headphones.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09DD33SDD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09JGF23V3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

I paired these headphones with bluetooth a few days ago (they said ""paired"" but had no sound).
I connected the converter to the HDMI ARC in TV via HDMI cable, and also to USB in the TV as power supply. Then I connected the converter to the bluetooth transmitter via audio cable (red and white cables), and got a great sound in my headphones.
I had the TV connected to a soundbar via optical cable. Now I can use only soundbar (ot TV speakers without the soundbar), only bluetooth headphones, or both at the same time.
The sound quality is very good. If you are looking for the best listening experience (bass, various music etc.), I can't answer because I was looking for a good quality sound via headphones and I got it.

"I got this tv for several reasons
- my tv of 10+ years died
- I’m retired
- I wanted a smart tV
- I deserve to splurge lol
- Price
- Size

My issue is after trouble shooting and calling customer service having several ppl transfer me going over the same steps with five different ppl and then waiting for them to get back to me because they couldn’t help and had to kick my issue up to another department
AFTER ALL OF THAT I get an email that tells me to reset everything which I’d done several times already and then they send instructions to go to my PC computer and down load something on my PC ( which I don’t own) put it on a usb drive and put it on the TV etc etc etc
Problem with that is
1. I’m an apple person
2. I’m retired from the entertainment industry and my laptop retired with me I literally gave it away
So 3. There are no computers in my house (well that’s not exactly true I have my original desktop square tan Mac from 1988 but I haven’t booted it up in over 25 years) but if there were a computer it wouldn’t be a PC

Of all the ppl I know I literally don’t know anyone who owns a PC

So that was the reason for me just giving up after exchanging this TV and having the same issues with the second one

Okay so these were the 2 issues I had on the 2 TVs I received and ended up returning back to Amazon

These issues were happening among several apps peacock 🦚 TV, Paramount TV, YouTube, HBO, Disney+, and Hulu

First and most annoying
1/4 of the screen is cut off. Why? No idea. example on peacock 🦚 tv I put on a film and it is a “Focus Feature film” on the screen I would see FOC and the next line Feat

I put on a move id seen or tv show and half of someone’s face was gone just cut off

On say HBO or on Disney I will have the whole picture BUT I have to have the sound all the way up to the maximum Volume be in complete silence or you can’t hear anything and even then keep the subtitles on God forbid someone whispers on screen you won’t be able to hear that shit LITERALLY

I’m not against doing the work. I know everything is not perfect for everyone. I understand you get want to pay for and you may have to do more work when you pay less for things.
I just think this tv is for a PC person due to its issues not being fixable with out owning a PC. In order to get the firmware you have to down load and install you need a PC believe me I tried on a friends MacBook and it can’t be done on the tv itself.

So mixed reviews for this TV
It’s not a bad tv
The picture is great when you get the whole picture the sound is great when you get normal sound but if like me you aren’t a PC person then buyer beware if the firmware ever needs to be upgraded it will require you to do so with a PC",B09WQPRMLF,...,Size: 85-InchStyle: TV Only,4.0 out of 5 stars

It really does need to be in a wall mount and they could add 25 bucks to the price to solve a problem or they could spend more than a dollar on the legs in the first place.

This TV freezes, sticks, stutters to the point that it has to be unplugged to reboot itself. This happens across many apps and when going through HDMI. It can happen after 10 minutes or 3 hours. I have updated it.

It truly is a shame. This TV has a beautiful picture. It adjusts to the light in the room and the colors are stunning. I have a Sanyo in my living room that doesn't look this good. The stereo sound is great and it will get very loud and not break up. It's perfect for my bedroom. I really wish it worked.

I cannot rent movies from Amazon or Vudu with this television. From Amazon the message says to ""use your phone or computer to rent this movie"" which really makes me wonder about this operating system.

"Honestly an ideal pick for a dorm/studio where space is limited and you want the feeling of a TV that you can’t get with a monitor. Android TV is fairly comprehensive although the low Ram and potential manufacturing QC issues (they are manufactured in India, I know because mine was still set there regionally) can make it hard for non tech savvy users to get the most out of their experience. Works for gaming but wouldn’t recommend for anything with Latency being critical to gameplay. Sound quality is nothing impressive whatsoever but is perfectly passable and can get loud enough for the type of space you’d use this in.

"You can immediately see the awesome difference in the amount & quality of the LEDs but no matter what I try this new camera is in my experience a step backwards. I have an LG C1 65"" and it has super thin bezels plus it's super thin. Which is what this new camera was suppose to be made for with it's counter weight design. Well there's no way to keep it still because if you have any sorts of bass with your sound it will move AND the camera is so darn heavy none of the optional 3M tape would last more than a few hours without it slipping out of alignment again due to how warm the whole camera structure gets. And why doesn't the colors get even less saturation than the Envision T1 model which was the con of them, too much color. Luckily they added a slider to turn down the saturation in the Govee Home app but on this Envision T2, it barely reduces the saturation of colors. To top it all off this camera on the T2 can't be setup on the bottom but that ended up being the best way for me to setup the Envision T1 on my LG C1.

One comment, installation: Only problem during installation arose when I had to make sure the dual camera piece visible on top the TV has to be perpendicular to the screen. The back support is supposed to be vertical, but that is impossible on my Vizio 55” TV as the back of the TV is not flat with the screen and it is about an inch deep, thus I had to improvise and use the extra sticking tape.",B0BCQ9YQYW,Love it,Size: 50-inch,2.0 out of 5 stars
"I like the T1 better. What i would say is to calibrate this camera the middle red dots between the cameras cant overlap. Turn the brightness to 40 and the saturation to 25. The dual cameras pick up so much more light than the T1. They also pick up reflections on your enterainment center more, if its glass you have to put something over it. Youll probably have to mess with your tv settings (backlight) to see more colors. If you need to restart ""box"" hold the power button and click the middle button four times. It took me two days to test all this.

Every other mode was fine out of the box

Update: Govee support has said a firmware update is coming oct 21 to fix saturation, white balance, and other things the flat out dont work. So waiting to see if that actually works.

" I've been a govee fan for about two years now. I loved the T1 though it did have it's issues. The lag was noticable and the color accuracy wasn't the best at times. It had a hard time reading certain colors. Because of the price I was always greatful anyway. Spending $600 for backlights just seemed ridiculous to me..

I'm beyond blown away with the T2. The color accuracy is beyond phenomenal. And the response time is so quick. Of course if you look for it, you'll notice the lag on scenes with quick movie lights/strobes, but I honestly do not notice any lag at all, which is something that really distracted me with the T1.

Paired with better accuracy, having double the LEDs really makes the colors blend flawlessly. I really feel like this is on par with another brands $600 lights, and for 1/5 of the price.

"After coming from the Govee T1, I am a little disappointed in this new version. There is a lot to like but it has a large shortcoming.

Pros:
easy setup.
Quality materials.
Fast color changing
App is pretty nicely laid out with many options.
Bright

1 HUGE CON:
Color accuracy.

Regardless of any setting, i cannot get the color accuracy to where I want it. I did not have this issue with the T1. I cannot get a good ""white"". It always has a pink or reddish hue to it. There also seems to be heavy green on a lot of images where there isnt much green or any green. Ive recalibrated numerous times, adjusted saturation all the way to 1%. Ive messed with the white balance constantly....cant seem to get it accurate.

I am wondering if this issue stems from the camera firmware. I noticed when calibrating in the app, the image the camera sees always has a greenish tint all over it(no there isn't any plastic packaging over the camera). It is not the same color as being displayed on my TV. It makes sense that this is most likely influencing the color output and making it impossible to correct the accuracy. I hope there is a fix! I want to like this product as much as my T1....ill update the review if anything changes.",B0BCQ9YQYW,"Need to make 65"" its own product",Size: 50-inch,5.0 out of 5 stars

"I love Govee products, their innovation, and usually their support department but there is a problem with the T2 sending the colors to the wrong sides of lights connected through DreamView and they have not responded to My Issue in the app. I posted about it in the forum and there are now 3 people with the same issue. No response.

To get near the right color I am only 3 clicks from all the way blue in White Saturation. I used purple to get it somewhat close and one or two more clicks makes purple pink then red. No point of anything at the midpoint or toward red. Saturation does almost nothing in altering colors.

I use to be able to have all DreamView lights at different brightness or click Same Brightness but that is gone now.

Pro is the mount on the camera it fits a thin tv now. Box was super nice too.

My entire house runs on Govee products but I would say don’t early adopt this technology.

"This light is a great way to enhance the theatre experience! It's one thing to have a LED light behind the TV to create ambiance, but having it adjust to the what's playing on the screen takes ti to whole new level. The installation was very easy and straight forward. Once you have everything connected, the next part is to set it up on the app. I originally setup the camera on top of the TV, but after seeing that someone had set it up from the bottom of the TV, I wanted to give it a try. I actually like it better. If you do set it up on the bottom, you just have to change the setting of the blue and red strip in the settings. It'll make more sense when you go through the setup.
Whether you use the camera on top or bottom, its important to adjust the white balance as well as brightness and saturation. When I first set it up, a black screen would result in a reddish light, and I didn't understand why. It wasn't until I selected White Balance and messed with the slider that I started to see more accurate results of the colors on the screen.
What's great about the Govee lights is that you can connect other Govee lights and create an even more elaborate light experience through the app. I do have a light strip that I will be connecting to this to see how creative I can get.
I am really pleased with the results so far!",B0BCQ9YQYW,T2 Sending Colors to Opposite Sides in DreamView. Overly Red in Calibration. Other Issues.,Size: 65 in,2.0 out of 5 stars
" What I like about this is it makes the show to be larger than what it is.

Installing took about an hour. The led strips stick on the back of the TV quite well. All the wires are long enough to reach the module that is also stuck ti the back of the TV.
I have a power strip that is close to the TV so the cord will reach for power.

When I first had it turned on it only showed red no matter what happened. Found that the hallway light was being deflected off a door next to the TV and the cameras would see it even tho they were calibrated.
Instructions say to have the cameras at a 90' angle but in this situation including a window in the same room u used the app to only see the TV and pulled the lines to the blocks. This helped big time. I also turn the lights out anyways.

It's correct on the color and at times seems off but it's OK and does not last that long normally only happens I guess when multiple colors on the screen. It's only trying to average the color out.
It really does a great job.

I also like where the app has option to also extend to other Govee product in the same room and also sends the color there too.

Now what happens if the TV fails. How do you move it from this one to the new TV. Will the double sided tape take out the leds to where you need new ones?
If that is so then I belive the price needs to drop half way. If it works after it then it may be worth the amount. To me the price seems to be steep for this even tho this is cool.
Perhaps waiting for them to go on sale is good.

" This is amazing. First, there’s a great video review of this product in the description - not the company ones, but an extra one. That dude does a beautiful job demonstrating how the DreamView works. My video is a sample of live tv watching with it on. I LOVE it. The coolest part is how it expands the television! It didn’t take long for me to stop noticing how it was changing and just enjoy the effect!

Heed the warnings about calibration. Note that you can recalibrate in the app if you think it didn’t go well the first time. It seems that the white saturation is the usual culprit and I had similar issues. It picked up too much yellow and that tainted other colors, but mostly white.

The only other issue I have is that it has to be turned off separately from the television. It is in no way connected to the tv. The camera is sending all the signals to the lights.

I haven’t tried everything out yet, but the DreamView is worth getting this system. I’ve backlit my tvs for years. It truly makes a difference on glare and eases eye strain.

"My family and friends have had TCL brand Roku TVs and I've always liked the quality of them. This television (TCL Google TV Model 43S446) came up for sale for around $180 during Amazon's Prime Days, so I thought I'd give it a shot even though it's the Google TV software model instead of the Roku TV software.

The Good:
The television was packaged well for good protection during shipment, it was easy to setup, and had good picture and sound quality. It does have a composite (aka: RCA or yellow/red/white) cable input which is nice for hooking up older devices. It is in the form of a 3.5mm jack though, so you'll need an adapter (not included). It has a good antenna TV programming guide (internet connection required), I personally prefer the Roku TV antenna TV programming guide, but this one is still very good.

The Ok:
The Google TV software is easy enough to use, but is much more cluttered than a Roku TV interface. If you prefer a simple, clean looking, easy to use interface, then a Roku TV is a better way to go. As I said, the Google TV software is still easy enough to navigate, and no problem at all for those with sufficient tech experience. Customers in older generations with less tech experience may need more time to get sufficiently acquainted with the menus.

The Bad:
Those familiar with TCL Roku TVs may be fond of the live TV pause feature, which allows you to rewind and/or pause live TV. This feature works very well on Roku TVs. This TCL Google TV has a similar feature, but in my opinion it is too much of a hassle to use. First, you can't simply rewind live TV like you could on a Roku TV, you have to actually pause it first for it to begin recording and to be able to rewind (unlike Roku TVs). So, if you miss something and want to rewind back a few seconds to see it again, you're out of luck. As for the pausing live TV part, the remote itself has no play/pause, fast forward, or rewind buttons. In order to pause live TV you have to go through a settings-like menu, which in my opinion takes far to long to do when you want to quickly pause a show. So, if one of the reasons you want this TV is for the live TV pause feature, don't get it; go with a Roku TV model instead. I considered returning it, because an easy to use live TV pause feature was something I really wanted, but I decided to keep it since it was such a good deal on sale. However....
After about a month of owning the TV, it started to have problems. One morning it wouldn't respond to trying to change the inputs, but that started working again eventually. The same morning, the TV tuner in it seemed to fail. None of the TV (antenna) channels would come in, every channel said ""No Signal"". I confirmed it wasn't an antenna issue or a coax issue. After turning the TV off, unplugging it for a minute, and plugging it back in it seemed to work again. So it may have been a Google TV software issue rather than the actual TV tuner hardware, but I didn't have a way of confirming that. However, TV tuners have been around since essentially the invention of television. Even the newer digital TV tuners have been around since, at least, the late 2000's. Since the technology is well established, that should be one of the last things you have issues with. So, for me, that was the straw that broke the camels back. I didn't want to take the chance of having more issues in the future, so I decided to return it since it was within the return window.",B09JVKRSF1,Govee Envisual,Size: 50-Inch,5.0 out of 5 stars

"I went with this because it has better D65 P3 and BT.2020 coverage than either the C1 or G1. They're all very close on P3 but it's better by quite a bit on BT.2020, and I'll take color accuracy over being able to crank up the room lights. 23.98fps material seems fine, and it's able to handle higher bitrate Dolby Vision material over the LAN so I don't need to reencode anything.

It kills the Nano85 I was using originally in image quality of course, but that's replacing a dying computer monitor where the edge-lit HDR won't matter.

Few regressions over the Nano / 2020 models:
1) Pause and play buttons on the remote are gone. I had to get a $9 RCA IR remote because I need these. I often watch stuff while I make food or paint and can't gunk up the magic remote wheel. Now I have a bunch of buttons for streaming services and voice assistants I don't use that I plan to cover with plastic and encase in epoxy so I don't press them. The 2020 remote pause and play buttons also work via IR, but as soon as you hit the wheel it pops up the ""incompatible remote"" dialog.

Bad form in general removing the pause & play, they're more useful inside the streaming services than the button for said service obviously.

2) The file browser for the internal player tries to thumbnail everything. For small files this is kinda quick but for a 120GB .m2ts with no preset thumbnail it takes forever, and makes initial browsing of the network each boot horrible. Why there's no option to not show thumbnails I don't know. Weirdly .m2ts will show random frames when selected like anything else, so why it doesn't just pull the first frame as a thumb is beyond me.

3) Signed 24 bit PCM surround and TrueHD 5.1 tracks now play as garbled screeching. I didn't test THD 5.1 on the Nano but PCM worked fine.

4) Some subtitles won't work, particularly with 1080p DolbyVision (internal pgs or external .srt). I've also hit 4k UHD DolbyVision subtitles that failed to display, while others worked fine. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to which work and which don't. For example the forced subs on the John Wick titles all work fine (including 1 & 2 remuxed with generated DV and 3 with native DV), but the forced subs on TMNT with Rifftrax audio fail to display. It may be an issue of multiple audio tracks messing it up, more testing is needed.

5) Not a regression, but since the BT and Wifi seem to have ungodly range I still get the random pairing requests from bored / stupid neighbors to share sound or video, with no way to block them from happening once short of a faraday cage around the back of the set. Please add an option to disable pairing requests? My simple Yamaha stereo receiver solved this by having a pairing mode that has to be entered first; my network is hardwired with wifi off on the TV so it just seems like a security risk to allow the random requests from any phone within 200 yards

Aside from those relatively minor nitpicks it's a great upgrade over the Nano series and an awesome price since I didn't need 120Hz or obscene brightness. I've only hit issues with the dynamic contrast in one source (cartoons) and it even manages to upscale DVD .VOB pretty amazingly (but sadly can't read the subtitle format used for those, so the old PS3 will see some use there).",B092LZNZB7,Beautiful clear picture!,Size: 50Style: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars

"I have this in my office - relatively small room. It's a regular sized bedroom. Can't remember the total square footage but not a masterbedroom but not closet sized either. In fact, it has a closet. So I have my work and personal laptops to the right corner of the TV. It sits in the middle of the main wall (where the door is) and faces a futon on the wall across it. I was torn between this x90 and a samsung q85. Since this Sony handles dark rooms better, without having to worry much about viewable angle (it's limit is something like 53 degrees while the q85 is much higher) I went with the x90. It's a small space so you're never going to sit outside the futon area while watching or playing something.
I managed to get a ps5 soon after, which totally synchs with the tv. Heck, you can even turn on both devices with the ps5 controller.
Even though the movie sucked, when I watched the Matrix:Resurrections, the part when they revisit the white room with the 2 burgundy leather chairs, the room was so white I had to put my hand up the first time they flashed to that scene. It handles blacks and whites very, very well; providing for a real nice picture.
Besides the viewing angle, one thing it doesn't handle well, which actually does affect me, is light reflection. If you have a window open or a lamp where the light directly hits the screen, it'll reflect it back. Hence, the dark room thing. The fix around this would be to get some LED lighting - either strip(s) or a bar - and place it on the wall over the TV so you can still light up the room without it ever coming in contact with the screen. I have a small Yamaha YAS soundbar on it which has 0 ARC connection issues (unlike my Klipsch soundbar) so I'm not too worried about the stock TV speakers. Who the heck uses those anyway?

"If I could, I'd give it a 4.5/5. Since my complaints aren't that important I gave it a 5/5.

Just an awesome-looking panel.
4k HDR content is so crispy and really pops.

I have it mounted to a wall using this https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TZBBPFY?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details and usually use an Amazon 4k Firestick for content playback (but when Jellyfin gets an official WebOS release soon I'll be using that). From my pictures you can see the mount doesn't block any ports/plugs so I got lucky there. Would recommend this mount.

Being an OLED, the near-instant refresh of pixels does make things look jittery without TruMotion enabled (couldn't find any black-frame insertion option), but I found setting TruMotion to ""Natural"" gives the best results without being an overkill soap-opera effect. I leave it on for all content (animation included). It's not perfect, but it's better than turning it completely off.

As for picture settings, I find ""Vivid"" the best out of the bunch. The other options make the image almost look like a weird color filter on top of the media that makes blues more yellowish, and darkens everything. I assume this will be fixed in future updates though, since I bought it so close to release...

The remote is fine. but I haven't played with it too much yet. Just wish it had fast-forward/rewind/play/pause buttons somewhere.

WebOS (LG's smart tv OS) is fine I suppose. This is my first experience with it. My only dislike of it is that your apps are quite small compared to the other content panels it displays on the home page (weather, sports news, sponsored media, etc.). But it runs at a decent speed. Even their browser isn't terrible and comes with (optional) ad-blocking which is a nice touch.

It has the option to do an speaker output + the tv speakers, which is interesting. Honestly the TV speakers aren't terrible, but their clarity isn't amazing. I much prefer leaving only my speaker output on (optical out to a speakerbar) and not using the TV speakers at all, as the hybrid mode muddles the clarity too much for my liking.

The WiFi speed is weirdly not that high (on LAN), at least when testing in the browser (as seen in the picture I attached). For comparison, I held my phone (Galaxy S9) in front of the TV and got ~304 Mbps up/down. I'm planning on wiring this later (it has an Ethernet port), but I didn't really notice any huge hitches playing local content anyways (over Jellyfin) so this probably isn't too important. Just odd..

The only really strange thing I've seen so far was an odd glitch effect on a few select scenes with people who're moving and far away from the camera. It's hard to describe, and only happened maybe twice while I was watching Guardians of the Galaxy vol 2. It looked like the people themselves flickered while the rest of the screen was fine. My best guess is the AI picture was having trouble with them being so far away from the camera in that scene. I haven't seen that happen on any other content yet, so maybe that movie itself was bad...",B092LZNZB7,Duuuude!,Size: 65Style: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars

The main difference is the 60HZ vs 120HZ refresh rate, which is not noticeable in most instances.

"THE CONS: The lG WebOS is poorly designed. The home screen has Ads and suggested movies, I find this pointless because I don't need those suggestions from the TV, the apps provide enough promotional content. The integrated LG free TV app cannot be removed. In fact, many APPS cannot be removed so you are forced to move them further down the list. Overall it's just busy with extras you don't need. LG just let me see only what I want. If you purchase the TV and do not have cable and only stream, sometimes if you push the wrong button on the remote it will goto ""LiveTV"" and you will get static (google how to turn this off)

This brings me to the remote, there is no pause button. and it should be backlit (at this price point) so you can see buttons in low light. The remote projects a cursor onto the screen but if this happens when you try to rewind you often jump too far back or forward in the show. Overall it could use a lot of improvement for users that just steam apps.

THE PROS: The image quality is amazing, It's mesmerizing. For the price point, I think it's a bargain. The TV pairs with my LG soundbar and once its paired you can use the TV remote to control sound.

"I specialize in tech reviews. As as professional photographer having TVs with the finest picture quality possible has always been priority one for me.

Read on to decide whether to buy the A series or the C:

If you don’t game frequently with your television, save your money and go for this “A.” As long as you can live with only having three HDMI inputs, you won’t be able to tell the difference in the picture. My son is an avid sports fan and gamer, too. The 60mhz refresh rate of the A series versus 120 can be seen when gaming but not in watching sports.

All else is the virtually same including settings options and the remote.

"Hoping to share from my trial and error.. and save you some time.

I purchased Samsung QLED & returned, Sony OLED Bravia & returned, and finally got the TV I was looking for with this one (LG OLED).

In the market for a new tv, went to Best Buy and the Store sales rep sold me on getting OLED technology. Got the Samsung because it was cheapest.. But was also cheapest quality. Got it home. mounted it. Said this ain’t it. Took down. Returned it.

At store another two hours. Said I want the best, don’t want to come back. Got sold on Sony Bravia OLED. Very expensive but figured it would be worth it. Got home, mounted it. picture quality was average at best. Super complicated to change the settings. User interface was rough. Said what did I just buy. Took down carefully cause thin tv could break.

Remembered store rep said LG OLED was second to Sonys OLED quality. So I looked on Amazon, read reviews, and bought LG OLED for half the price than the Bravia. Tv got here mounted it, and the picture was twice as good as the Bravia. Had built in AI that automatically adjusts and maximizes picture to my Apple TV without having to change a ton of settings like Bravia. User interface intuitive and so simple - universal remote moves like a mouse on computer and took over Apple TV control automatically.

"As you can see from the picture, the FIRST TV I was sent was not an acceptable product. And honestly, I believe they sent this shattered screen one on purpose because I called & complained about a delivery hold up, so I believe they just grabbed a broken one & threw it on the truck because I suddenly & very quickly got it like the next day, strangely enough. Even more strange was that the two capable gentlemen who delivered this one had it strapped securely to the inside rear of the truck with absolutely nothing around it (in an empty 10ft radius) that could've damaged it so badly & they were not reckless or dropsy, so I'm still not sure how a TV shipped & handled that securely got shattered across the entire front of the screen while being handled by such careful pros. Thankfully the replacement was much better and I received a free, ""DELUXE DELIVERY & UNBOX"" which was a very misleading thing because when they got here w/ the TV, the young gentleman in charge continually explained how they could do nothing but take it out of the box, plug it in and ensure operation, which amounted to making sure it turned on, and then take the box and leave. That's it, that's all! They literally wouldn't even help me lift it onto the table where it was to sit. I still don't know what was ""DELUXE"" about this Deluxe Delivery & Unbox. Oh, & the same guy complaining about all they couldn't do for me instead of focusing on what he could do? He also had to (quite annoyingly) repeatedly tell me that they weren't even ""supposed to deliver to you because of the construction"" going on in what used to be our apt bldg's parking lot. Yet Amazon delivers here practically everyday. But for some strange reason he was insistent that the construction out front was a definite No No for Amazon deliveries (or maybe he meant just for TV deliveries). I'm stil not sure. Either way, still makes no sense.
So now to the TV. I ordered this 65"" Samsung Crystal Tizen for TWO MAIN REASONS.
1) It had a voice remote & 3 voice assistants to choose from, but since I like Google & they were pushing this as a Google TV w/ Google Assistant, that was a big selling point for me. Actually the biggest selling point. I knew I could very easily connect my already established Google Assistant like I had done on a 4K Chromecast I bought from Walmart in 2020. But sadly, THAT NEVER HAPPENED! After speaking extensively to Samsung TV support, Google & Google Assistant support, Amazon support, & even some support chat bots & emails & community support forums & you name it, I tried it. The best advice I got to simply move forward from this nightmare fiasco was to go ahead & just use one of the other two remaining voice assistants that were still available on the TV, Samsung's Bixby, or Amazon's Alexa. Both of which I dislike. What I had seen of Samsung's Bixby from interaction with it on my Samsung Galaxy phones and tablets was that it was fully advertisement saturated, and I dislike that immensely. Whereas Amazon's Alexa is just one big speaking algorithm designed primarily for nothing more than selling more Amazon merchandise. I don't need that on my TV remote & I'm also not buying another device to connect to it just to get it to work properly with the TV. Because of course if you select Alexa as your voice assistant they immediately try to upsell you into an Echo or some other unnecessary thing you don't need to operate a voice assistant on your TV remote. I've been using Roku voice remotes for 3 or 4 yrs now & they work just fine w/ their system as is. No extra device purchase necessary. My Google Chromecast works amazingly well with its Google Assistant voice remote. Both of those items were less than $100 each. Buuuut, a brand new 65"" 4K Samsung Crystal Tizen has the WORST voice assistant remote I've ever encountered. And it WILL NOT HOOK UP TO GOOGLE ASSISTANT. So, on to the . . . .
2nd REASON I PURCHASED THIS TV?
Because it had 4K UPSCALING!!! What a huge feature in a TV this inexpensive! I'd purchased a Sony Blu-ray player w/ 4K upscaling and it was amazing. I fell in love with how old DVD movies were brought up to nearly 4K quality with doing nothing more than putting the movie in the carriage and pushing play. So when I saw that this Samsung Crystal Tizen had 4K upscaling in all picture viewing formats, BOOM, I was all in. That 4K upscaling & the 4K picture clarity in it's Dynamic viewing mode have been the ONLY redeeming qualities in this entire fiasco of a purchase.
Talk about a bunch of ridiculous false advertising, pitiful customer support & delivery inadequacies, & more difficulty & flawed merchandise than one person should have to endure in an entire year? But of course these are all avoidable issues that I somehow created on my own when I clicked, ""Add to cart"" & made a purchase, fully believing & trusting that i was going to receive what i had read & saw with my own eyes, in the time i was told I'd receive it.
(Speaking of, did I mention the reason I called and complained about the delayed shipping to begin with was that my item, the broken TV in the picture, had been sitting in a little suburb about 20 minutes outside of town for going on 2 days and had not moved according to the tracking details? Which is why i believe when I called to inquire about it, that is what they sent me. Nearly 2 days in one spot 20 mins away from me? What would you do?)
Oh, & apparently I'll never have Google Assistant on this TV. It just won't connect. Keeps telling me to login & connect but won't let me. I've been FORCED to use Samsung's Bixby as the voice assistant for the TV & remote. UGGGHHHHH!!!
IN CLOSING - ITS A GOOD TV FOR THIS PRICE, BUT IF THEY RAISE THE PRICE? LOOK ELSEWHERE. AND REMEMBER, THE ONE FEATURE YOU'RE PERSONALLY AFTER? THE ONE FEATURE THAT MAY BE THE SELLING POINT THAT SOLD YOU ON THIS TV? IT'S HIGHLY POSSIBLE IT MAY NOT WORK OR WORK CORRECTLY. It's also a very high possibility that if you run into shipping and delivery issues, you can end up with a broken TV and have to do a long & painstaking, time consuming, long time waiting for your money back, refund and return.

"I am finding many,many features to adjust and turn on or off to control every day. The speakers are OK for normal sound and an EQ can be enabled. I bought 2 Bluetooth 5.0 headsets from SoundCore and noticed some inputs had that Bluetooth sound sync mismatch showing lips moving too late or early. I read about AptX LL (low latency) enabled TV and Headsets required for Video use with syncing sound with video. The sync off because I FF or RW streaming bit too much ...with non AptX phones I feared I had to buy 2 new headphones but it went away by it self. HDMI input #2 has the advanced type HDMI plug. I used that for my Xfinity Arris 4K cable box with a DVR HDrive or SSD. You need the small new XG1v4 DVR/cable box to output 4K to TV from them or they can send the tiny non-DVR one to go with normal HD box that does cloud only 4K. The only problem is the XG1v4 4K DVR cannot be controlled by the small Universal Remote provided currently. I tried the 20 attempts many times and even chose Arris as the manufacturer and the model #AX014ANM and the XG1v4 name and nothing works yet like on the other Xfinity boxes I had for a while. It says make sure your cable box is set for IR infrared to work but the cable box is fixed RF radio frequency only not dual type. Too bad the Remote is not dual output. Have to have 2 remotes.

"Delivery was fine, I guess. It was a “drop and run” situation - last time we ordered a TV from Amazon delivery was via a private company that actually unpacked it and plugged it in. This was delivered by Amazon and it was left on our porch with no knock or doorbell ring.

This TV Arrived with damage to the box and the back of the TV crushed. Miraculously the TV worked but we still returned because we were concerned that the the back would give out when mounted.

They picked up 5 days after delivery and it was picked up 6 days ago - not sure how long it would take to get back to Amazon to credit my card. We are still waiting as it says return started but there is no confirmation of pickup or any easy way to track it online since it’s a private 3rd party company which is concerning. That experience will determine if we order a replacement via Amazon or Costco.

The picture was good, set up easy through Samsung app that we had to download. The remote is weird/wonky and the interface is kind of clunky. I don’t love that. Though to use remote to get back to channel guide/source. But if you are familiar with newer Samsung products it will probably come naturally to you.

"I ""mistakenly"" put a thumb in the screen of my 2020 Samsung TU7000 - 65 inch and heard that dreaded CRACK‼️ The ""T"" showed up where my thumb print was‼️ I replaced it with the 2021 AU8000 - 65 Inch and to my surprise it has MUCH DEEPER BLACK than my previous model. The Black in this TV is AMAZING‼️‼️ IT'S STUNNING how DEEP the Black can get in this TV and almost would seem like it's an LED OR OLED, but It's Not‼️‼️ The UI is a little ""laggy"" at times, but it seems to be getting better. The previous TU7000 remote works with THIS TV‼️‼️ It's half as thin as my previous model with better color in my opinion. It has to 2 USB ports and 3 HDMI ports (one with eArc).

"So we just picked this tv up at best buy at the price that is advertised for on here on Amazon. We weren't expecting better quality than our old TV(32 inch vizio) but wow we were wrong. Took about a 45minutes from start to finish. And when we upgraded from our old TV we were happily suprised. Was weird using a fire tv remote for a toshiba tv though. Picture quality is awsome. With the addition to this new tv we had gotten youtube tv subscription for our cord cutting cable service. And we are really happy and excited. Less cables=less frustration for us when adding dvd player, gaming consoles or our Samsung dex to this tv. We plan to add the Dex to this tv so we can eliminate the use of our laptop and just add a external hard drive, wireless mouse/keyboard, printer, all to that device to be used on this beautiful tv. Setting is a little weird still to navigate but the user friendly layout of the fire tv platform for this tv is why we chose it. The volume from where we use to be was about 30-45 on our old tv now we are using volume level at about 15-20(maybe to 24). That should tell you something. Picture quality is a huge step up. The almost bezel free rim around the tv is also really nice since this is just about a perfect rimless tv but there's maybe a1/8inch of rim around tv. Also it's got I believe supports on the tv on the feet for anchor supports.",B0924XSHB2,"Great screen, sound ok",Size: 43 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"If you are looking for a review of the latest technology features of this product and a discussion of how its controlled via a dozen interconnected electronic devices linked through WI-Fi and Bluetooth so the TV can be turned on and the channel selected while your auto driving car is self parking itself in your ""smart house"", this review is certainly to disappoint you.

There are those who demand and use every feature on their ""Smart TV's"" and then there are those of us who simply watch TV and want it simple to use. Turn it on, pick the channel and watch. My wife and I are in this we ""want it simple and have it work"" group. Truth is, we probably won't or don't use 90% of the electronic features and probably never will. We simply want a very good picture, an easy to use remote or control method and the item to be reliable. This TV has not disappointed us and we are very pleased with this purchase.

Purchased during Prime Days, I was very pleasantly surprised to learn this TV was to be delivered via Best Buy's Geek Squad, the very next day after purchase. When I received the email from Best Buy, they asked me to select a delivery time of either 7am to 1pm or 1pm to 8pm. I selected the later delivery option. Less than 24 hours after purchase, the Geek Squad van pulled into the driveway at 9am, with the TV. I was a little surprised they had never called me, but the delivery time worked out fine. The two young men delivering the TV set stated that they hoped the ""earlier delivery time"" would be OK and since we happened to be home, it was.

They carried the TV box right into the upstairs bedroom where it was to be installed. They mentioned that if I had purchased an optional service through Best Buy that they would have installed the TV, including mounting the TV on the wall mount (if desired) and that they would also remove and dispose of our old TV, which had been purchased through Best Buy many years earlier.

The one young man doing most of the talking pulled out his phone and checked to see if it was possible to ""add this upgrade"" to the Amazon purchase while they were in the house, so they could handle the removal of the old TV and set up the new set. He did state that the package from Best Buy which included these optional services apparently couldn't be added to my purchase since it was a Prime Day Special, but I could add the option by going directly to Best Buy's website. The purchase of this optional package provided a number of benefits including in home service, etc.

The TV works great, it was very helpful to have it delivered and placed right where it belongs and it was very helpful to have the old TV removed and properly disposed of, as it was a struggle for the two delivery men to get it down the stairs and out of the house, there is no way I could have done it on my own and what would I have done with it, if I could get it removed from the house?

There is an electronics recycle firm within an hours drive from our home, where you have to pay them to take the electronics. It requires you must transport the items to their facility and the old TV was 5' tall and nearly 6' wide and nearly a foot deep at it's base and weighed at least 175 pounds. It would require a trailer to get the set to the recycling center, assuming of course, one is able to get the old item out of their home on their own. Instead, for one fee, the entire situation was resolved and within minutes, my new TV was set up and all of the packaging removed along with the old TV set. Plus, the optional Best Buy package had numerous other benefits, including in home service on the new TV etc.

The TV works great, the delivery experience exceeded my expectations and the set up of the new TV plus the removal of the prior TV and all new TV packaging, made the purchase superb. I am glad to see Amazon and Best Buy working together in this way. Their collaboration made the purchase an even greater deal and wonderful experience.........",B0924XSHB2,Great TV,Size: 55 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought the Toshiba 75"" C350 Series LED 4K UHD Smart Fire TV (75C350KU) for $499.99 on December 18th from Best Buy. I set the delivery for 12/24 so that I could find the television in a store and cancel if it did not meet expectations. Even the stores that stocked this set did not have it on display, so this review is after having the television in my home for a week.

I was very impressed with the packaging. The box comes in two pieces -- a short base and a tall 'cover' held together with four plastic clips which can be reused if the set is returned. The set was held firmly in the middle of the box by Styrofoam packaging with an air filled 'pillow' and cardboard protection between the screen and the box. Hard plastic strips protected the screen from careless handholds. A plastic sheet that covered the screen was easily removed without leaving any kind of residue.

Out of the box, no dead pixels, no physical damage, and nothing missing. Good start.

I attached the stand, plugged in power, and powered on the set. Once I logged in to Amazon, I could access my antenna via an Amazon Recast -- wirelessly. Upscaling on this set is outstanding. SD looks great. From the westerns of the 50s and 60s to the dramas of the 80s and 90s to modern HD programming, everything is clear and properly sized/scaled.

Then I plugged the TV into my antenna. The picture quality was better than through the Recast. UI was still Fire TV. For television, I can choose a grid style guide that integrates antenna and streaming. Top of the screen is a description of the selected show. I like that. So, I plugged in a TiVo. The TiVo autoscales to 1080p. It looked almost as good as the antenna. Good enough for me to choose the TiVo input over the antenna input...sometimes. New Year's Eve, I was hopping among inputs watching a New Year's Celebration and the 1080i programming looked great via the Recast, the TiVo, and straight from the antenna. For the most part, I am watching the antenna plus streaming media via the Fire TV grid style guide.

Audio is very good. There are two 10w speakers. I'm not an audiophile, but they sound fine to me.

My desk is on the same wall as the television in my bedroom. From my desk, the viewing angle is probably around 160 degrees. The viewing angle of this television is excellent. Not as bright as head on, but very watchable.

The remote resembles a Fire TV remote. It is about half an inch longer. There are four additional buttons for TV control -- channel up/down, guide, recents, and quick settings. There are also four additional buttons for Prime, Netflix, Disney+, and Hulu. The remote contains a mic and the TV is Alexa enabled. On a couple of occasions, pressing a remote navigation button once has caused multiple actions.

There are four HDMI ports, one USB port, one LAN/Ethernet port, one digital audio out port, one RF input (antenna), one headphone out, and one AV input. Movies, music, and pictures can be played off a device attached to the USB port. The port powers drives that require up to 500mA. I am using the port to power a Roku that requires 5V/1A. No problem -- not even the expected Roku INSUFFICIENT POWER warning.

The TV has a Native refresh rate of 60Hz with a Motion Rate of 120Hz. I did not experience motion blur watching basketball or football. Hockey will be the ultimate test.

Documentation is less than sparse and completely unnecessary. Complete specs are available on the Toshiba web site.

If this television proves to be durable, it was a steal for $500.",B0924XSHB2,Great TV,Size: 50 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The size and picture quality for the cost is pretty unbeatable. It's a great screen, colors look great, bevel is thin. It's got all the apps we could ever want. It's been a really solid tv.

That being said there are a couple things to know. You'll definitely want some kind of a sound bar with this. The audio coming straight out of the tv sounds like it's coming out of a tin can.

And the most annoying thing—for whatever reason the ""motion smoothing"" feature always kicks on by default. So if the tv puts on the screen saver mode (which kicks on very fast), motion smoothing kicks on automatically. And a lot of times, even when you go to the settings, it'll say that it's off. So then you just have to turn it on and then off again and it's fine. We've gotten very fast at accessing this in the advanced settings. Not the end of the world, just annoying. If motion smoothing doesn't bother you, this won't be an issue for you.

If the sound was better and the motion smoothing wasn't an issue, this would be a 5-star tv for sure.",B0924XSHB2,Love the picture!,Size: 50 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I purchased this tv about a month ago to replace my previous tv that died unexpectedly. I wanted something cheap and this was cheaper than my old tv and bigger! It's perfect for my small apartment. Pros- easy to use, easy to set up, all of the apps are built into the tv so it makes things much more seamless. Cons- the color! I don't know what it is, but when I watch live tv (cable) the color is off. It's not all shows but there is definitely a difference in the picture color quality. This is not an issue with any of the streaming apps at all. Also the sound when using cable is much lower than when using the apps. It's a very weird thing I have tried to fix several times. I also don't like that I can't set the tv up to always turn on to the cable. It always turns on to the home app screen which is fine but a bit annoying because I have to always have both remotes with me for the tv. But it's a great tv.

"Bought this TV to replace a several years old Samsung 65"" TV. As much I enjoyed the Samsung TV, the picture quality on this Toshiba TV is so much more vibrant and brighter. A few months ago bought the size 55"" model of this TV which then led me to buy this 75"". As always I set the picture to Movie mode, with super resolution turned on, and dynamic contrast set to low

Pros:
- Great picture quality with vibrant colors, excellent contrast, and sharp bright picture
- Smooth fast action on both HDMI (60 HZ) and non-HDMI (120 HZ)
- Sound quality with Bass and Treble turned up to max, TruVolume turned on, and DTS Virual:X set to Medium rivals my Excellent Sony soundbar with nice bass and clear dialog
- Have noticed no issues with up-scaling non-4K sources
- Mutli-screen feature works great. You easily can switch amongst what sources you currently and have been watching
- Absolutely no issues with speed and TV's responses when playing games with or without using HDMI inputs
- Material quality seems quite high and the TV well made
- Amazon Fire TV has excellent ease of use and TV setup
- For those who whine about this essentially being a Hisense TV, well, all TV panels these days are made by a few manufacturers. Manufactures buy these panels and then customize the rest of the TV to their specs
- You can spend far more on a similar size TV, but not sure if you would get much more value

Cons
- For functions that require much screen traversing, I miss the Samsung TV's cursor like remote",B0924XSHB2,Great TV,Size: 43 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars

If you buy from the people who supply the echo dot you do not get it. Huh???? Took four calls to fig out that nugget.

"Picture is great, sound not amazing but we use a soundbar and surround. Which sometimes it has issues automatically connecting to but usually solved by turning it off and back on. Many have commented on the remote pooping out after a couple weeks. This did happen to us, first the mic search stopped working then the whole remote.

If any of the review horror stories come true, I will simply purchase a new TV. I do not deal with customer service people, ever.

"I love the TV, but the remote is pretty wimpy. It’s the same remote (or similar to) the remote we use in the bedroom for the Roku connected to a Panasonic Plasma screen that’s over fifteen years old. Television is perfect. The remote, not so much. It’ll pass, but we’ll probably add a universal remote to replace it and add it to our arsenal. That cost will be added to the overall cost of this television and it’s less than par remote. We’ll remember this and will know better when we begin looking for televisions to replace the older one in the bedroom. We’re also disappointed that there’s no other way to introduce audio to our home theatre system without purchasing a third party piece of equipment that will change the digital audio output to RCA inputs. I know it seems like older technology, but the television doesn’t even provide any Bluetooth capabilities to use a third party device we already have. We will absolutely do more research when it’s time to upgrade the plasma screen in the bedroom. We'll have a similar issue there.

Update: We chose to purchase a Roku Voice Remote that works great with our new television. We’d prefer using a keypad, but this works. We’ll probably still go a different route when we replace the plasma screen in the bedroom.

Update: We woke up one morning and the televise wouldn’t display a picture. We contacted the vendor and they said someone local would come to my house to see what the problem was. Nine days later, a local television repair company showed up. He and his “helper” proceeded to take the circuit board off my television then scratch up the front screen stating the board was bad and the television was no longer operable. I asked what I was supposed to do with the non-working television and he said I’d have to dispose of it myself. I asked about the $469 I had paid for the television six months ago and he said that Hisense would be reaching out to me within 24 hours. Three days later, Hisense called and said they’d be sending me a refund and I should expect a check in the mail in 10-14 days. I asked about them just sending me a replacement set and they told me that this would not be an option. I even offered to upgrade from a 55” screen to a 65” screen. Nope. Wasn’t going to happen. Four weeks later, the check arrived.

Would I ever purchase another Hisense television? Probably not. I think I’m going to take my money and purchase TCL 65” screen from a local big box store. Hisense and their “customer service” sucks.",B09JHSVTSD,Great fast shipping,Size: 43 inchesStyle: Google TV,5.0 out of 5 stars

"Only owned this about a month so take with a grain of salt but so far it's great, and for the $309 I paid I'd even consider it as a gift for others. In addition, the Amazon delivery people were super helpful and courteous -- lugging it up two flights of stairs, taking it out of the box and even setting up the legs which i couldn't have done on my own. They definitely deserve a union. The TV has a 3.5 mm which I like so that I have the option of attaching multimedia speakers while I'm deciding on a bigger sound system. Wish it would have more RCA plugs but I guess nowadays that's normal, and it has a lot of other connection options. Not used to the Roku interface but it seems user friendly enough. Cautiously hopeful that this discount brand will turn out to be worth following.",B09JHSVTSD,Thrilled with this TV,Size: 55-InchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars

"Pros:
- Great picture quality, especially for the price
- Good performance when using apps like youtube, netflix
- Decent enough menu systems

Cons:
- Fragile. A guest bumped his hand on the screen and it completely destroyed it. It was so light I didn't even notice it until much later when I turned the TV on. There was no visual damage (broken stuff) at all. Keep it clear of literally anything that could possibly hit it, no matter how soft.
- Too bright for night time. On a completely dark room, late at night, I see myself having to go into the settings to manual tweak down the ""contrast"" since the brightness can't go down enough. Problem is, this only works on active videos, not while you're (for instance) on the video selection screen.

"Bought this as I moved countries and TV’s don’t convert power. We had a Bravia 55” LCD from 2017 so needing a new tv just for the move was not my favorite thing, I felt like I could have kept using the 55” I had. Then I got this TV and I was shocked at the picture difference! The LED panel is much brighter, the contrast depth greater and overall picture quality amazing. Sony does their blacks well and their brights are bright it is the kind of movie quality I prefer in a TV. That being said, I am really pleased with LED tv. The glossy screen is not an issue the picture outshines any glare from windows. It’s not a matte finish like and older LCD but it does work.

"HISENSE PROMO FRAUD UPDATE:

So I received a return shipping label for my TV return. However, the attached email states that the label is for a laptop return for a laptop purchased at Costco. I am returning a TV not a laptop. Also, I purchased the TV from Amazon not Costco. I am afraid to use the label since the email has the wrong purchase details. I am even more worried that Hisense is attempting to get out of its obligation, regarding the promotion and my return. I will now have to call customer service again on Monday, as they don't accept calls on the weekend. This will be the second time I have had to call, and it takes a long time to get through the automated phone response system. My advice - if you purchased a Hisense TV from Amazon under this so-called promotion, you have 30 days to return it to Amazon. After that, you are stuck with dealing with Hisense. Therefore, if you think you are not happy with the purchase, you should return it to Amazon within the 30 day return period and thereby avoid having to deal with Hisense.
WARNING: HISENSE PROMOTION FRAUD - I purchased this TV under the 100-Day Hisense Promotion. ""Try it for 100 days and return it if you don't love the TV"" Well I decided to return it because it has numerous problems, including audio problems, turning off by itself, etc. The return was approved by Hisense. I received a confirmation email stating that a return shipping label would be emailed to me within 5 business days. However, it has been five business days and I received no label. I called Hisense customer support and was told they are ""having a problem "" with their return shipping labels. I was told to wait another five days for a label, and if I haven't received a label by then, to call customer service. I don't know how they can have a ""problem"" that prevents them from issuing return shipping labels. I fully expect that I will not receive a label - again - and I will have to call back and they will have another excuse as to why they haven't provided me with a label. The time limit for returning the TV once the return is approved is 30 days. Can't very well return it with no return shipping label. I can foresee them using delay tactics until the time limit expires, and then they will refuse the return because it's outside the time limit. I should have known that this promotion was too good to be true. I have changed my review to 1 Star because of this issue.
UPDATE #2: I called HISENSE customer support about the return shipping label. They say the shipping label I received from them is the correct label and to call UPS to schedule a FREE pick up. The label is for UPS Ground service. However, UPS refuses to pick up the package. They insist that I must pay a $30 fee and I must have a UPS account so they can bill me for the pick up. Hisense insists that the pick up should be free. So here I am, caught in the middle. I have no way to get the TV to a UPS location. To say that I am upset and disappointed with this experience is an understatement. Hisense advertised the promotion as having easy returns, but it is anything but easy. Not sure what will happen next but I will have to call Hisense AGAIN (this will be the third time) to try and get this straightened out. I fear that I am going to be stuck with the TV (which has several issues). I may call Amazon, or file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, to see if they will accept a return. What a major headache and nightmare. I will never buy a Hisense product again, especially under a Hisense promotion.
TV Review: I received my brand new Hisense 65-inch U6H Model 65U6H HDTV today. This was sold and shipped by Amazon. The TV ships in it's original retail box, so no extra packaging to provide added protection during shipping. My U6H arrived with some damage to the outer box. The corner top of one side was damaged, and there was a puncture in the middle front of the box - right in the middle of where the TV screen would be. There was no obvious damage to the TV. Setup of the TV was quite easy. The legs fit perfectly into the base of the TV and each leg only requires two screws to secure to the TV. The screws went in easily and without issue. I was actually able to do the whole setup process myself, and I am a short 56 year old man. The TV is surprisingly light and I was able to lift it relatively easily by grasping it with one hand on the bottom beneath the screen and one hand to balance it on top. I was very impressed with how easy it was to get the TV out of the box. Just cut the three plastic straps, open the box, remove the styrofoam insert, an the outer box just slips right up and off. I was also impressed with the inner packaging. In particular, there were protective plastic shields on the sides of the TV, as well as plastic material all around the frame of TV which strips off easily. So as far as packaging, and the ease of physically setting up the TV, I would give it an A+.
I had no trouble plugging in the power cable to the back of the TV and turning it on. Immediately, the TV started the setup process, which I found to be easy and quick versus other TVs I have owned. I was easily able to connect to my WiFi, and tested out several different apps including Netflix, Amazon Prime, and YouTube. Everything happened quickly and smoothly - better than any TV I have used before. There were no glitches with lip sync while viewing content through apps - a problem I had previously with a Hisense TV. Overall, I would give the smart features another A+. Now, we get to the meat of it all - how does the TV perform.
My first immediate reaction was wow. I immediately tested the picture quality by watching an 8K Dolby Digital video on YouTube, and I found the colors to be super vivid and bright. In fact, I think the backlight was a little too much, as white colors came out totally indistinctly. However, I was easily able to adjust the backlight and picture settings using the remote. By the way, the remote seems to work very well - there is virtually no lag between pressing a button on the remote and seeing the TV respond.
Now is where we get into some problems. Yes, the colors are vivid, out of the box. As far as brightness is concerned, I found it exceptional. In fact, I had to dial back the brightness a bit. Mind you, I watch TV at night in a semi-darkened room. However, if there is an area where Hisense excels, it is in the brightness of it's panels. The U6H is no exception. Despite it's advertised relatively low peak brightness, something like 600 nits, I believe it is plenty bright enough for a large majority of consumers. Yes, you could go with a U8H or last years UHG, and get much greater brightness and backlighting. You also would pay considerably more. But in my opinion, the U6H will more than satisfy the majority of users when it comes to just peak brightness. If only brightness were the only issue.
Sadly - and I wanted to like this TV so much - there were problems right out of the box. First, the Hisense webpage for this TV advertises that it supports HDMI 2.1 on all of its HDMI ports. That is not true. I can confirm that it only supports 2.0. Period. If you are a gamer, this is a problem for you, as it is for me. And if you are a gamer, you know why. If you are not a gamer, you can skip the rest of this review, until the conclusion.
I bought this TV knowing that it is a 60 hertz panel. So I was prepared for that. I have my PC hooked up to this new U6H, using Windows 10, with an NVIDIA 3060ti graphics card. I am using a high quality, high speed HDMI cable, so my problems aren't the HDMI cable. The problem is, that this TV will not accept full 4K - in HDR - from a PC. It has a limited color gamut. It will not process 4.4.4 Chroma in 12-Bit or 10-Bit color at 60 Hz. In fact, it is limited to 4.2.0 Chroma at 60Hz in 8-bit color.
It will process RGB color from the PC - but again, only in 8-bit color. In short, you will not get more than 8-bit color from this TV when hooked up to a PC. This is depressing. I just sold a 2020 Vizio V-Series TV that I bought new for $250 on clearance, and it supported HDMI 2.1, as well as 4.4.4 Chroma
or RGB at 60 Hz, 12-bit color. Which leaves me asking myself, why did I buy this TV? It doesn't do what it is advertised to do - it doesn't process HDMI 2.1. It doesn't process more than 8-bit color when connected to a PC - like my old Vizio did - and to top it all off, the TV shut itself off within 1 hour of turning it on. This is exactly one of the problems that I had with the U8G - for which I was unable to get warranty support - they just wouldn't respond to my support requests. I finally had to return the TV because the return period was about to expire and nobody from Hisense had responded to my complaints. So...where does all of this leave us?
Should you buy a Hisense TV or not, and if so, should you go with the U6H? Well, I bought this 65 inch U6H after having a bad experience with the U8G that I had purchased - a bad experience with the TV and a bad experience with customer support. The thing is, I really want Hisense to succeed in it's mission - to bring high quality TVs to the public at a reasonable price. But I will say that I bought the U6H during a Hisense promotion - I have 100 days to try the TV and return it if I am not happy. So, I decided to give them one more chance to get it right. Right now, I'm not feeling very good about my purchase. I just wanted a TV that I wouldn't have problems with - I don't want to have to go through the whole warranty process, or the Amazon return process. But now it looks like I will have to go through it all again. In conclusion, there is something to be said for going with a more well-known brand like Sony, Samsung, or LG. You pay a little bit more at the outset, but in my experience it is worth the extra cost when it comes to overall quality and customer support. Another issue I would like to address is updates. I want my TV to update automatically. And I expect a new update to bring improvement, not make things worse. This is an area where Hisense lags. The last Hisense I bought, the U8G, had audio problems, and Hisense has yet to come out with an update to solve the issue, even though this is a problem going back a year or more. MY CONCLUSION: Hisense makes super bright panels. If brightness is your priority above all else, then yes, you will be happy with a Hisense U6H. But there is so much more that goes into buying a TV. For most people, buying a new TV is a major expense. Like me, they don't want to have to return a TV or try to get support from customer service for a TV that should just work as advertised, out of the box. Unfortunately, quality control and customer support are areas where Hisense fails miserably. I understand that some TVs come off of the assembly line with defects. What matters is, does the company stand behind it's product? In regard to Hisense, in my experience the answer is no. They do not stand behind their products. Accessing customer service for support or warranty service is difficult, and they do not respond to requests for help. This means that many people will be forced to return their Hisense TVs because they cannot get support before the return period runs out. Exactly what happened to me with the U8G. In closing, I would say this - buying a TV is like buying a car. You should buy the best you can afford at the time. The prices for Hisense TVs seem like a bargain - on paper. But I believe, based on my experience, that you will get what you pay for, and in the end the chances are pretty high that you will have problems with a new Hisense TV, and when you try to get help from the company, they will blow you off. You will then be stuck with a TV that doesn't do what it's advertised to do, from a company that doesn't stand behind it's products, wondering as I do - why did I sell my 2020 Vizio TV. UPDATE: So I was able to get the TV to accept Chroma 4.4.4 color from my PC by adjusting the settings in the NVIDIA control panel. However, I had to lower the refresh rate to 30Hz to get it to do it, and the color depth is still stuck at 8-bit color and ""Limited"" dynamic range. When I change the refresh rate to it's native 60Hz, the only color format available is Chroma 4.2.0 with ""Limited"" dynamic range. So no matter what you do, the TV only outputs the minimal 8-Bit color depth. I can also select RGB color format, which then allows for full dynamic range, but only if I change the refresh rate to 30Hz. So in summary, if you want the TV to run at it's native 60Hz, you are limited to Chroma 4.2.0 with 8-Bit color and limited dynamic range. To run RGB you will have to lower resolution to 30 HZ, and you will get full dynamic range but still only 8-Bit color. Or, you can run Chroma 4.4.4 at 30 Hz with limited dynamic range.
UPDATE: So a little while in, and I have some important updates regarding the 65-inch U6H that I purchased. First, there was a firmware update from Hisense which pushed through automatically. That was an improvement over the U8G that I had owned previously, so way to go Hisense. Also, the update seemed to do some good, as the TV is more stable, i.e. not turning off by itself so often. However, now the TV will not connect to my 5GHz WiFi - it connects for a moment and then disconnects. I'm forced to use 2.4GHz WiFi. It seems to work fine on 2.4 though. Also, this TV has trouble dealing with my Vizio M-Series soundbar. When I turn on the soundbar, the TV shuts off occasionally. At this point, I have to say that although the picture quality is pretty good, I would not pay full price for it, which right now is $598. It's just too glitchy. I paid $549, and if I keep it Hisense will give me $100. So for $449...yes I'd say it's worth it. But not $598.",B09YVWYQM6,Quality TV,Size: 32-InchColor: TV Only (32S335),5.0 out of 5 stars
"UPDATE 11/02/22: I have since been invited to join Amazon's Vine programme. Rest assured, though, that I will always provide frank and updated feedback on all my reviews. This Hisense was actually bought by me, and my opinion is still that it's a gem.

First, let me preamble this review by saying a previous review of my 43” Hisense was the top review when I wrote it 5 years ago. That’s because I continually updated that review, and I intend on doing the same for this one, so please check back.

I give modern technology about 4 to 5 years (or, depending on price, 5-6) before I replace it for something better. That was the case with my old television, a Hisense which I bought for the Olympics that year. It was the first time I had ever heard of that brand, and honestly, I was wary. I’m not a fan of Chinese goods, since they’re built for affordability, not reliability. To my surprise, my old Hisense is as good as ever, and now a relative has inherited it, as the colours and 4K technology still hold up pretty well.

Nevertheless, I had been tempted by Amazon’s new affordable FireTV television. I pulled the trigger for their 55” Omni series, but almost immediately returned it. If you’ve never owned a 4K TV, that’s a good starter set. But the washed out colours and lack of features (no full array dimming, Quantum Dot, and HLG) made the return inevitable. So for 120 dollars more, I chose the 55” UH6 Hisense, which had tempted me with its instalment plans and dazzling features.

The second I turned on this Hisense, I knew it was a home run. POP POP POP. The hue! The brilliance of the whites! The deepest blacks! That’s what I had dreamt of all along, and I got it.

It has taken me a long time getting the settings just right. My old settings weren’t working as you can imagine, since the U6H offers so much more depth that one doesn’t need to yank up the contrast or brightness to get a good picture. In case this is of some help to you, here they are:

Picture
Backlight

Local Dimming High
Backlight Level 100
Automatic Sensor OFF

Picture Mode “Dolby Vision IQ”

CONTRAST 50
BRIGHTNESS 44
COLOR 55
TINT 0
SHARPNESS 10

Advanced Settings

Color Temperature LOW
Motion Enhancement OFF
Motion Clearness OFF
Noise Reduction HIGH
Digital Noise Reduction HIGH
HDMI Dynamic Range AUTO
Active Contrast HIGH
Color Space NATIVE
Low Blue Light OFF

I bought some 8K certified HDMI 2.1 cables for around 22 dollars (less on promotion), to be able to use it in the 2.1 slot to get the best audio and video. Just make sure that they are labelled “certified” for 2.1. Since it’s relatively new technology, the reviews can’t be more than 2 years old.

I also bought the new FireTV Cube, 2nd generation, to be able to get the most out of my new Hisense. It was half off during Prime Day, and I couldn’t have made a better co-purchase. The promotional addon 99 cent channels have really made it zing to its full potential. If you really want to enjoy your new set, though, you need to get one of the big boys: they have the most Dolby Atmos movies and series.

Having mentioned Dolby Atmos, here’s the only real negative about the Hisense. Its native speakers are excellent, but if you want the full Dolby Atmos experience, that immersive feeling you get in a theatre, you’ll need to buy a soundbar which decodes Dolby Atmos. That can run you from 400 to 900 dollars, new. My still very decent 5.1 Vizio soundbar doesn’t have Atmos, but it’s Dolby Digital Plus sound is brilliant all the same. It took me forever to figure out that you have to untick the CEC functionality, or else eARC will take over, and send the audio signals to my non-Atmos soundbar. If you want Atmos without a soundbar, you’ll have to make do with “TV Speakers”, until you buy one. To check it, head over to a major streaming service. If you see the precious double logo (Dolby Vision and Atmos), you hit the nail on the head. I suggest using the movie “Okja”, or “Black Panther” as your test movies for sound. The Atmos sound will blow you away.

DETAIL: If you don’t have a soundbar which decodes Dolby Atmos, you’ll need to use the Hisense’s own TV Speakers. Go to “Settings”, then, “Channels and Inputs”, then “Inputs”. Deselect ‘HDMI control’. You will now hear movies in Dolby Atmos. Otherwise, it’ll be decoded as Dolby Digital+.

I uploaded some photos for you to see the full range of colours you’ll get with the U6H. Check out a YouTube channels featuring animals. The wildlife videos are a joy to behold with your new set. The DETAIL. Incredible.

I’ll be adding to this review, as mentioned above, when I find anything which might help those considering buying it. Even one week in, I can tell you this is a no-brainer: buy it.

A similar set by Samsung with all the bells-and-whistles the Hisense U6H has would run you a cool thousand!",B09YVWYQM6,Love everything about this TV,Size: 32-InchColor: TV Only (32S335),5.0 out of 5 stars
"I wasn't sure how I'd like this Google TV, as I've generally leaned toward Amazon's Alexa.  I was intrigued by the features and price, so decided try it.  All I can say is WOW. 

Packaging was great - opened it up, and legs are right in the Styrofoam top padding, so you can't miss them!  Got help pulling it out of the box.  Couple screws to attach the legs, and it was ready to set up!  Will eventually mount on the wall, but wanted to make sure I liked it better than the Vizio I'm replacing.  Based on what I've seen the last few days, it'll get mounted this week! 

I wasn't sure what to expect for a ""Google Smart TV"".  I was absolutely surprised how easy this was to set up.  After powering it up, it walks you through step by step.  You connect it to your Google Home app (which I had to install).  It allows you to update settings on TV using your phone, or even use it as a remote.  Nice features and handy to have! It took longer to get set up compared to a Roku or Amazon device, but overall was smoother and more ""complete"". The other apps have you up and running quicker, but then you need to go into settings and add the apps. There's still some of that with this, but it covers the major subscription apps in bulk, so overall it saves time over the other systems. Like many other SmartTV's, logging into services can be done via phone or password.

What really impressed me was the Google TV features. I enabled Google access to the TV itself as prompted during the setup and trained it, speaking various sentences as prompted. Now I can say ""Hey Google, power on"", and the TV powers on.  Other commands work as well = ""Open Netflix"", or ""Play Survivor on Paramount"".  Of course volume control works too!  I really like that this is built into the TV - no need to use the remote or hold buttons.  I did find this seems to go to sleep, but I'm sure it's a setting to keep it active at all times.

As for TV itself, I love it!  Colors are vivid, bright, and clear.  There are plenty of HDMI ports, and they're clearly labeled.  Setup features for the TV itself are very easy to navigate. Loved the default picture, though in a darkened room was just a tad too bright.  Adjusting the picture is crazy simple - between the included 'modes', and the custom controls that can be applied to each, you can easily adjust for any lighting condition.  I'm impressed with the QLED display!

Sound quality also impressed me for this price point model. I've had to get sound bars for other TV's due to 'tinny' sound, but this has clear sound, and it's more than adequate for our room.

Overall, I'm really pleased with this 55"" Smart TV!  Easy setup, fantastic picture, great features and sound, and all at a great price. I can highly recommend!",B09YVWYQM6,Good TV for the price,Size: 32-InchColor: TV Only (32S335),5.0 out of 5 stars
"this product is great for the price. I wished it was cheaper tho! haha. but let me tell you my experience about it. first of all the packaging was ok. it was easy to install. you need to screw two metal stands to the TV. the stands looks stable and firm. then you have to plug it in and that's it. it was easy and anyone can do it. specially it is light weight and can be handled by one person. during the setup you have to connect to wifi. the wifi search and finding it was really fast and easy. and then few steps to connect your gmail account to the TV and finally if you have accounts on Netflix Hulu and other channels you will enter your creditionals and it will be finalized. these steps are also really easy and fast. now it's time to go and see how is the screen quality. the screen is 4k and with this budget is one of the best options available. it uses quantum dot technology which helps you have wider range of colors. the Variable refresh rate has been improved and this option would be more pleasant if you are a person like me who plays video games a lot to be more smooth. the contrast ratio in this TV is one of my facorite aspects which is pretty great. this TV has a great quality in watching movies and shows. it can well handle reflections if you have a home which gets lots of light during the day like me. but keep in mind you cannot put the TV in front of a window that has direct light and expect this TV doesnt show the reflections!!! it can handle well lit room. next thing that might be important is sometimes you want to watch a movie from your collection and it has low quality like 480p. I tried it and surprisingly it upscaled it very well. the quality of 720 and 1080 upscaling is great which I expect every 4k TV do that but upscaling 480p is not easy I believe and I loved how it does. the borders are 1 cm and I consider it thin and I like as it is and the overall thickness is also around 8cm which I believe it is great for this price.
the last thing that I forgot to tell is the quality of remote control, the buttons are really smooth and soft. it works from distance and it responds to your commands really fast. overall I liked it. maybe if I want to mention its disadvantage with this price would be I would expect them to add HDMI 2.1 compared to U6G so the refresh rate could increase more but still its not noticeable. again with the money you are paying you cant expect it includes everything.",B09YVWYQM6,Tv delivery,Size: 32-InchColor: TV Only (32S335),5.0 out of 5 stars
"I am extremely satisfied and happy with this TV so far. Personally, think that its one of the best TVs for the price range.
1. Modern TVs have built in OS- this one is Google TV, which I like. The controller has a google assist button which is useful, but to be completely honest, I find myself using my apple TV most of the time (apple has been locked up in their “walled garden” lol). Nevertheless, have been impressed with Google TV: the apps that I use were in the app store, easy to use, responsive.
2. Picture quality- was expecting to picture quality to be lacking, but so far, picture quality has been superb. I use my TV to watch movies and shows, I don’t have a video game system connected to the TV so I can’t comment on how the picture looks while playing video games.
3. Sound quality- the previous television I owned, had poor sound quality, to the point I almost bought a sound bar. This TV- the sound quality has been superb. I have a small living room, but regardless of where I am in the living room, I could hear the sounds perfectly (sound is loud and rich).
4. Remote control- simple to use, not many bells and whistles. I primarily use my phone to control my TV, which is an option with this TV.
5. Packing- a saw a review that complained about the packing, I was worried too, but the TV arrived with no damage. The box I received was well padded and in great shape by the time I received it. It was delivered by a Prime truck, not sure if that makes a difference.

In summary- great TV for the price, awesome picture quality, great sound, ok remote control.",B09YVWYQM6,Sony Big screen modern look,Size: 32-InchColor: TV Only (32S335),5.0 out of 5 stars
" I bought the U6H 75 inch TV in late September, 2022. I am writing this review about 3 weeks later. I am very pleased with the purchase overall. I use the TV to watch movies, sports and TV shows. I am not a gamer, and I am not a TV tech expert. I bought the Hisense S214 soundbar to go with the TV, and I bought a ethernet to USB port adapter to use a wired port from my router to maximize speed. I plug it into the USD port and get about 300 megabits per second speed (the TV has USB 2.0 ports). I watch the TV with Theater Night mode with Motion Smoothing turned off.

For 4k (HDR) movies, it looks outstanding. The first movie I tested with is Thor Love and Thunder. The movie has bright color scenes, dark scenes and black and white scenes, so I think the movie is a good test for the TV. I was very pleased with it.

For sports - I played around with several modes, including Sports, Theater Day and Theater Night. My original plan was to have a Theater Day settings with motion smoothing for sports, and everything else as Theater Night, but I decided it wasn't worth the effort for me. I enjoyed watching sports on Theater Night mode without motion smoothing, so that is what I kept. 4k Sports are incredible (I have seen football and soccer on it). Regular sports - I think baseball looks best, followed by football.

I had not used Google TV before - I am used to the Fire TV, but I found it easy to use. The setup on the TV is easy if you have the Google Home app. I have YouTube TV, and that goes very well with the Google TV.

For sound, I use the HDMI ARC port to the Hisense soundbar. I use eARC and passthrough - it seems to sound better to me than the other options (Auto / PCM / Dolby Digital /Dolby Digital Plus). I don't have a Dolby Atmos soundbar so I can't comment on the Dolby Atmos feed from the TV. The CEC works well with the soundbar as I can turn the soundbar and TV on and off and change the volume with the TV remote.

Overall, this TV is a great value, especially when I got it on a discount and during their $100 gift card promotion.",B09YVWYQM6,WARNING: HISENSE PROMOTION IS A SCAM,Size: 32-InchColor: TV Only (32S335),5.0 out of 5 stars
"The picture quality on this TV is amazing. I'm replacing a TCL 5 series 55"" from 2018 and there is no comparison. The Hisense 75"" blows the TCL away from a picture standpoint. I will say that the ROKU browser on the TCL is more intuitive than the Google TV on the Hisesnse, but I'm sure I'll get used to it.
The 75"" appears to have an IPS panel so the picture doesn't degrade at an angle, but unlike most IPS panels I've seen this TV is capable of nice deep rich blacks with minimal blooming. I'm honestly blown away by the picture quality at such a low cost.
The fact that this TV has Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, EARC and local dimming at $799 is amazing.
The sound quality from the set itself is okay but not great. It gets sufficiently loud but sounds a little hollow. I connected it to my Atmos capable sound bar and the EARC allows for complete passthrough of uncompressed Dolby Atmos and DTS and of course you can control the volume of the soundbar with the TV remote. The remote, once paired to the bluetooth allows you to control the TV without having to point the remote at the TV.
The build quality seems to be fine if nothing special.
Now for the small issues that to me aren't a deal breaker but are definitely a nuisance.
1. Out of the box the remote will not pair. To fix this do the firmware upgrade.
2. The remote Now app will not pair with the TV. This is a must to use with Alexa. I have not found a work around for this. I could see this being a deal breaker for some but I'm more concerned with picture Quality.
Bottom Line: For $799 I would say this is a no brainer despite a few small issues.
I've only had the TV for a few days so I'll try to update this if anything changes.
Update: After less than a month of use I've had to take the set back to factory start up 3 times for various issues and am about to do it a 4th time.
1st major issue the TV for no reason stopped communicating with the sound bar so no sound.'
2nd major issue is that the guide has never worked for live TV.
3rd major issue and this is the worst of all. The TV comes on loads up and once you select a program to watch it goes into a reboot loop. The only way I've found to fix this is by doing a full factory restart. Having to factory rest a new product 4 times in less than a month is simply unacceptable.
Update: 70 days in and Google tv has stabilized and is working somewhat better. I still like Roku better.

"I've purchased 2 of these in the 75 inch size. 1 tv has been great. Love the Google TV interface, very easy to setup and sign into my streaming apps. Oddly Youtube TV is buried in the apps section and you have go to all apps and then hold the OK button down to reorder things so that the apps you want show up on the google tv main page. Picture is great for the price, especially since I am coming from an older LG Plasma that isn't 4k.

The second tv though... yikes. Screen was dead on arrival. Hisense sent out a tech after some excruciating support calls, but it took 1.5 weeks to get someone out here. Tech basically was like yeah they are going to have to replace it, so he took all the tv internals out of it and put a huge X through the panel and then left. It then took 3 weeks for another new tv to be shipped to me. This was supposed to white glove setup service so they could verify that it worked fine. Instead the delivery team (3rd party company) dropped it off and said all they could do was bring it right inside my door, even though the outside of the box said room of choice delivery, unpack, assemble base, power on and check. Called Hisense immediately and support told me to just check it myself. This is a 75 inch tv and was crazy to ask me to just do that myself. In any case, I did and when I plugged it in the wall it was immediately clear that the panel had damage. Called support back again and they basically said they need to escalate my case. So now I have 2 broken 75 inch tvs taking up space in my house and have no idea what I am supposed to do with them. Hoping that they actually get me another tv before my 100 day guarantee runs out HA, and take away the two broken tv's since you can't just put them out at the curb or fit it my car. Absolute nightmare trying to get a working tv and the support is awful to deal with. No updates ever, I just keep needing to call back in to see if someone can check on my case.

So if you buy one, just hope it works out of the box, if not be ready for a poor support experience.",B09YVWYQM6,"So glad I tried this 55"" Smart Google TV!",Size: 32-InchColor: TV Only (32S335),5.0 out of 5 stars
"My friend told me about this TV and since we had an old non smart tv in our bedroom, I decided it’s time for a new one. Very impressed with this one. Took me 5-10 minutes to set up and ready to watch. Really good looking TV and the sound is great too. Bright during the day and there are many picture settings you can choose from. I’m not really into TVs that much but just wanted something nice but nothing too fancy. Well, this seems very fancy and I love it so far! For the price you can’t beat it. I did a lot research and this one hands down had the best specs and reviews for my budget. I also love that it comes with Pluto TV which is basically free cable. I hadn’t had cable TV in 5 years so it’s nice to watch news when I wake up again. The remote has a Disney and Prime button besides Netflix, YouTube and Peacock which is nice.

"I purchased this 55” TV to replace a smaller 45” Roku TV that I had. This TV uses a Google Smart remote so it was different than the Roku I am used to, but I really like it. I’m a big fan of Google so I like that I am able to connect my account to everything on the TV. The set up is pretty straightforward by just following all the prompts on the screen. The color is beautiful and the quality is amazing. It comes with legs to stand it up but I just put it up on my wall where the old TV was. It’s a pretty big television so it’s a little heavy but not too much. I’m a tiny person and I was able to lift it up with my teenager. So far I’m pretty happy with the way it operates and the picture quality. I can’t really speak for the longevity of this device since I’ve only had it a few days, but I’ll update in the future as I get more use out of it.

"Hisense 65U6H review.
Bought this because of price and value, and because of positive reviews elsewhere. The two-year factory warranty also played a large role.
Took me a little over week to get it adjusted to the point where I can say it’s awesome.
I worked in broadcast TV engineering for a lot of my career, and am amazed at where video technology is today. One of the bittersweet things is the ability to adjust specific parameters.
Original main concerns were lack of ""texture"" and sharpness.
Got about 95% of the way to awesome via adjustments.
The thing that put it over the top to get to awesome was setting my Series 3 HD TiVo to ""native"" for the HDMI output. Now the Hisense TV does the correct video processing, and is not fighting with and dealing with the TiVo output. Plus the Hisense processing and conversion is 14 year newer technology.
There’s a lot of interaction between settings. Be patient. Make smaller adjustments, and you’ll likely reach a great picture.
Out of the box —- No DSE. Screen consistency is as perfect as I’ve ever seen. No dead pixels.
We use it mostly to watch television via cable, antenna and streaming.",B09YVWYQM6,Updated: Google TV is a work in progress,Size: 32-InchColor: TV Only (32S335),3.0 out of 5 stars
"We have had the 75"" set for nearly a month and we are very happy with the picture quality and performance so far.

This unit has an IPS panel vs. the VA panel that is reported on the smaller TVs of the same model. For us, that is not a problem as we rarely watch the set in complete darkness and the wider viewing angle works is a greater benefit. In complete darkness and with dark scenes, the back lighting is visible in the dark areas, but I really cannot say whether it is better or worse than a comparable VA unit - it's much better than our previous 8-10 year old TV (JVC BC50R).

Color reproduction is really great out of the box and we only did a minor amount of tweaking to our liking on top of the ""Theater Day"" mode. When not gaming, we have motion enhancement set to ""Film"" and it does enough to keep a natural look on anything we are watching. Motion enhancement turns off automatically if you have a video game console connected (PS4, Switch in our case), but it did not detect games started on our HTPC, and had to be turned off manually. To get the best color reproduction from your consoles, it's best to enable HDR and Full Range color on the console, then set the TV's ""HDMI Dynamic Range"" to ""Auto"" and ""Color Space"" to ""Native"". Setting ""Color Space"" to ""Auto"" seems to sometimes pick the wrong setting and your TV's color reproduction will be off from what the console is outputting.",B09YVWYQM6,The tale of 2 tv's,Size: 32-InchColor: TV Only (32S335),5.0 out of 5 stars
" I bought a Hisense TV for my garage, as you can see it hanging on the wall. (I watch TV while I'm detailing my bike or working on other projects.) I liked it so much that when it came time to replace the TV in the living room, I went with Hisense again. I was not disappointed!

The Hisense new 'Quantum ULED' has a picture that is better than any other TV at this price point. (I did a lot of research.) The blacks are REALLY black. (I like this for the perceived depth of field.) The colors are super vivid and there are no breaks in gradient, like other TV's in this class. (There are no 'bands' in contrast from light to dark.) The images are crisp and clearly defined. I watch a lot of 4K streaming and the visual experience with this TV is fantastic.

It's internet ready and I had no problems connecting it to my home network. It works very well with Alexa. I also like that I have one button access to Prime Video and Netflix. My wife and I like movies and not having to deal with multiple remotes for that is very nice. The voice command feature is convenient and is a lot easier than scrolling through multiple commands using buttons.

It has all the wiring connections you could want, to hook it up to your home theater system. I used them all and the sound is fantastic.

There is no way that the video I attached to this review can show you how great the quality of this Hisense TV is. But, I hope you get the idea. It's really, really great.

"Love the tv. Looks good. Picture is bright and very clear. 4k smart tv looks amazing. The photos attached don’t do the tv justice. Sound is good with different settings for various shows/sports. Good price and value for all the features.

Google tv is already on the tv along with preset buttons for channel selection. Don’t need to add Amazon Firestick to this one. Way better than our old LED tv. It was packaged well with no damage.

The remote is easy to see with my old eyes. There are buttons for Netflix, Prime video, YouTube, Disney, Tubi, and Peacock. There is a button for Google assistant also.

The 55” tv is the perfect size in my opinion. The 4k is beautiful when it is available. The picture is great and the remote is easy to use. I am very happy with this purchase.

"The color is good with this 55"" U6H, but it is really comes to LIFE when watching HDR or Dolby content. When watching such content it gets BRIGHT all in the correct places. I recommend setting the PICTURE CONTROLS to ""Theater Day"" or ""Filmmaker Mode"" try both and see what you like. Under Picture Advanced Settings: set color temperature to LOW and Filmmaker Mode Auto Detection to ON, Active Contrast to HIGH, HDMI Dynamic Range to Auto, and ""all"" Motion and Noise Reduction settings to OFF. I also like the TINT set to R3. Sound for this TV is okay for just everyday tv viewing, but add an AV Receiver with good speakers and this will turn your living room into a movie theater, or maybe a good sound bar would help as well.

Although this is a budget friendly TV, it supports Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos cinema technology.

Native 4K content looks great. It has a variable refresh rate up to 60Hz and a motion rate of 240Hz. It also upscales lower resolution content and supports HDR content.

"This tv has decent color and can get very bright, depending on the setting selected. I am not a fan of the control because it is small and rounded in the back, which makes it difficult to handle.

However, my biggest problem is with the television's ability to display YouTube, Netflix, and Disney. The image always shows up tiled/pixelated. You literally see a bunch of pixels. However, when I went into the tv's internet browser and loaded up YouTube, it shows the picture just fine. Also, if I plug in a fire stick, the picture shows up clear as well.

I spoke with several HISENSE reps, on their chat, and they weren't really helpful. They kept blaming my internet speed. It doesn't make sense that a firestick, using the same internet connection, can display a clear picture, but the actual tv is not able to. Even the tv's internet browser displays YouTube videos, but the actual HISENSE YouTube app does not.

I've tried turning off all the extra settings, with no success. The tv is only usable if you have a streaming device because the native apps have some issues and don't work properly.

"Background: We purchased the 65-inch S535 model about a month ago but weren't very satisfied with it. We saw the new S555 model released recently and the price is the same, so we decided to give the new model a try.

Here're the pros and cons of the S555 model compared to the S535 model:
+ (2~3 seconds) faster response time in terms of opening apps and loading movies.
+ The brightness of the S555 model is better than the S535 model (prbably the same as the S546 model. The power rating tag of S555 is 275W compared to S535's 190W).
+ The S555 model has much better picture quality as you can see in the attached photos (S555 on the shelf, S535 on the floor. In case someone is curious about it, the shelf is IKEA's KALLAX which fits the 65 inch TV perfectly). We set the picture settings of both TVs to the same, and the S535 TV's color is obviously uneven and yellowish.
- The S555 model's number of contrast zones for local dimming is half that of the S535 model.
- The frame and stand of the S555 model is worse than the S535 model (painted iron-like frame vs. textured steel frame; plastic stand vs. metal stand).

Additional comments:
I have a feeling that TCL North America is trying to hide the tech specifications in the NA market, which makes it hard to compare different models before you purchase. However, TCL does provide detailed tech specifications in the Chinese market. Also, here's a fun quote from TCL China: ""To put it simply, with dozens of contrast zones, the overall picture quality can barely improved. For 100+ contrast zones, the overall picture can be significantly improved. For 300+ contrast zones, the overall picture quality is comparable to the OLED"". It's a shame to see that TCL North America is gradually reducing the number of contrast zones for the 5-series.",B0B81QF15L,Solid 75 inch TV for the price!,Size: 32 inStyle: TV Only,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I use this as a monitor for a Geochron world calendar, and it looks great. I don't use any of the streaming stuff. The TCL operating system allows me to set a default HDMI input port and that's all I care about. The picture seems bright and clear. Putting LED bias backlighting on the back makes the picture pop even more. The Geochron display changes slowly so I don't care that it has only a 60Hz refresh rate. The frame appearance is low-key and doesn't call attention to itself. There is a night light on the front; a very small lamp that remains lit when the TV is off, but it can be disabled. The power plug is on one side of the TV and the rest of the connections are on the other side. VESA bolt holes worked fine for wall mounting. The feet seem a little flimsy. The remote wastes space on dedicated buttons for streaming services I will never ever use. Do I wish it had more contrast zones? Sure, why not.

I have used this size for desktop applications for years now and this is just the latest iteration for me. I love the 43in size for productivity as I can have four good sized windows open at any time and quickly move between them. I was worried that my potato of a work provided laptop would not run the 4k screen (and the provided docking station did not) but with some work I got a thunderbolt dock hooked up and was good for the full 4k 60p. I know that this size is not for everyone but for me I looked at a lot of different options even ended up with the 49in ultra wide in my cart at one point but the price of this is unbeatable. You could spend $1000 dollars on an ultrawide or you could get this for less than $400 I mean it is hard to make any other decision really. Now on to how it looks. it is not super bright or extra deep colors but for office work it is perfect in my book. I also own the new 42in oled for home use and it is no comparison the oled thrashes this in every possible metric but it is also nearly three times the price so it better. My only real gripe with these screens is that at arms distance away the corners get a bit soft. This is not a deal breaker but you will find your self shifting to find the close button in the far right corner from time to time. A tiny bit of curve to the panel would solve this but that is a bit of a pipe dream.

"I have had this TV a couple of weeks now so I've had time to see how it fits into my life. First of all, I am a 77-year old woman living alone and I was able to set it up completely by myself. The directions were straight forward and easy to follow. The hardest part was putting the feet on because the screws were black and the insertion points were also black. The actual set up of the programming was amazingly easy. Most apps or features I wanted on the Home Screen could be set up using a QR code which then went to your account for features like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Apple TV and others. No complicated setup was required. I really appreciated that!

I even set it up to give me weather in my area. If I want to go to Netflix or even Apple TV I just click on that option and I'm good to go. If I want to access the Home Screen of my satellite dish provider, I just click on HDMI1 and it takes me there.

There is also a feature that allows you to use Alexa to find things but I haven't done much with that yet. It sounds like it will be fun to explore though.

All in all, I had this TV unboxed, set up and ready to watch in less than an hour. That, to me, is success!",B09RRMBP4C,Easy Setup!,Size: 32 inStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars

The sound and picture are amazing. I especially like it’s AI sound/AI picture function. Negates the need for calibration in my opinion. It is being used outdoors until it gets cold. The picture and sound are flawless either on a sunny day (minimal glare) and especially at night. Speaking are loud with just enough bass. Better than most televisions at that price point.

"First thing one should appreciate, is the sheer size of the item. Massive at 65"". The box arrived by Amazon freight at 6:30 am, but it was worth it because I feared it would be left in lobby which is not secure.
The box is massive and quite tall.

Set up requires a minimum 2 able bodied people. The box pops open on the side with some light pressure and the TV is there for all to see. Picture quality is impressive and will show non-HD images well enough with very little pixelation. HD and 4K signals are crystal clear and dynamic.

The remote is easy to navigate and only a little intimidating at first. It is actually set up rather simple, but I can appreciate this. The options on the screen are numerous, but navigating is simple. Take from me a non-technical person on any level.

Connects easily to sound bar with minimal fuss. I got it for cable and movies, so I don't use the Wi-Fi and smart options. It may be a smart TV but I'm a dumb guy, so that's that.

I would recommend the product and the freight was spot on. Was concerned I'd get a tv with cracks or dead spots in screen. This was not the case, and I am grateful. The price point can't be beat, I know because I searched. Amazon has some of the best policies of any company so ordering from them is a no brainer.

"My family and friends have had TCL brand Roku TVs and I've always liked the quality of them. This television (TCL Google TV Model 43S446) came up for sale for around $180 during Amazon's Prime Days, so I thought I'd give it a shot even though it's the Google TV software model instead of the Roku TV software.

The Good:
The television was packaged well for good protection during shipment, it was easy to setup, and had good picture and sound quality. It does have a composite (aka: RCA or yellow/red/white) cable input which is nice for hooking up older devices. It is in the form of a 3.5mm jack though, so you'll need an adapter (not included). It has a good antenna TV programming guide (internet connection required), I personally prefer the Roku TV antenna TV programming guide, but this one is still very good.

The Ok:
The Google TV software is easy enough to use, but is much more cluttered than a Roku TV interface. If you prefer a simple, clean looking, easy to use interface, then a Roku TV is a better way to go. As I said, the Google TV software is still easy enough to navigate, and no problem at all for those with sufficient tech experience. Customers in older generations with less tech experience may need more time to get sufficiently acquainted with the menus.

The Bad:
Those familiar with TCL Roku TVs may be fond of the live TV pause feature, which allows you to rewind and/or pause live TV. This feature works very well on Roku TVs. This TCL Google TV has a similar feature, but in my opinion it is too much of a hassle to use. First, you can't simply rewind live TV like you could on a Roku TV, you have to actually pause it first for it to begin recording and to be able to rewind (unlike Roku TVs). So, if you miss something and want to rewind back a few seconds to see it again, you're out of luck. As for the pausing live TV part, the remote itself has no play/pause, fast forward, or rewind buttons. In order to pause live TV you have to go through a settings-like menu, which in my opinion takes far to long to do when you want to quickly pause a show. So, if one of the reasons you want this TV is for the live TV pause feature, don't get it; go with a Roku TV model instead. I considered returning it, because an easy to use live TV pause feature was something I really wanted, but I decided to keep it since it was such a good deal on sale. However....
After about a month of owning the TV, it started to have problems. One morning it wouldn't respond to trying to change the inputs, but that started working again eventually. The same morning, the TV tuner in it seemed to fail. None of the TV (antenna) channels would come in, every channel said ""No Signal"". I confirmed it wasn't an antenna issue or a coax issue. After turning the TV off, unplugging it for a minute, and plugging it back in it seemed to work again. So it may have been a Google TV software issue rather than the actual TV tuner hardware, but I didn't have a way of confirming that. However, TV tuners have been around since essentially the invention of television. Even the newer digital TV tuners have been around since, at least, the late 2000's. Since the technology is well established, that should be one of the last things you have issues with. So, for me, that was the straw that broke the camels back. I didn't want to take the chance of having more issues in the future, so I decided to return it since it was within the return window.",B09JVTVN9F,Too soon to rate with accuracy.

"A few years ago I picked up a TCL 65""4k 6 series which out of the box was fantastic. After purchasing this 50"" 4k 4 series I was a bit disappointed as the picture quality was no where close to my other TCL. The picture quality was hazy and not nearly as sharp as expected for 4K and the colors were dull. I tried the various color settings and calibration but to no avail. I watch over the air stations via an outdoor HD antenna and only a small handful of the available stations were discovered, not sure why...so I reconnected my older TV and it discovered 4 times as many stations. Lastly I used the TV output to connect to a stereo receiver, the only analog out is the headphone jack in the back of the TV and when connected you lose the ability to control the TV volume.",B09JVTVN9F,ARC VS Bluetooth,Size: 55 inchStyle: TV Only,4.0 out of 5 stars

"The Q80B in 55"" is a beauty to see. It's my 1st 4K TV. It's super clear and bright. Things I like are the picture obviously. I like the 4 hdmi ports. It's got optical audio out. 2 USBs....
It has no RCA hook ups at all. It has no physical buttons at all. So don't lose the remote. The remote interferes with my Xbox Series X. Which is kinda annoying... One feature I expected is auto on. My old tv would turn itself on when you start a gaming console. I have not found that feature on this TV. I'm really missing that feature. The interface is confusing to use. Maybe it gets better when I have more time to use it...
Overall 4K is awesome and I'm happy with the price. I paid around $1.1k which was my top limit. I'm happy to get a Samsung in 55"" with 120hz refresh rate at that price point.

There are no numbers on the remote. It looked more like an Apple Remote. Curious.
Fortunately, the cable remotes worked and I put the Samsung remote in the drawer. Will only use it for setup changes like brightness, timers, etc.

"Wow! The brightness, contrast, clarity and color are amazing on this Samsung 85"" TV. I already own a 60"" Samsung smart TV so knew I wanted to stick with Samsung brand because picture quality was great but even my 60"" TV can't come close to the picture quality of the 85"". I know the sheer size of the screen makes viewing easier, especially for me (older and wear glasses) but I am blown away by the clarity and rich colors on this TV. If you play a Blu-ray with HDMI cable it is even better than a movie theatre. I have noticed objects in movie scenes I never saw before due to the brightness, beautiful colors and clarity of this TV. I hooked up my sound bar and sub-woofer to the TV for use with movies but honestly, the improved sound from the built in 6 speakers on the TV sound great too. I knew I wanted to upgrade to and 85"" Samsung TV and as soon as Amazon put them on sale, I nabbed one. Heck, they even gave me 10% more off because the box had a little hole in it which didn't hurt the TV one bit. Overall, I am very happy with this TV as the picture quality and size are amazing!

"I had been looking for a new lg screen for a while. This one had my attention but was on the fence due the high price compared to other screens of the same size. Once samsung opened up the gaming hub to this TV I decided to jump on it as I was also going to buy an Xbox. That brought it to a more justified price. But beyond that the picture is amazing. Real blacks and whites. Colors are incredible as is brightness. I was also going to buy a sound bar but held off. Glad I did cause the sound is really quite good as is. Only thing I added was a skull candy crusher head set for games and movies without disturbing others. Those are great too and hooks up flawlessly. Negatives that I have experienced so far is sometimes the audio, picture are out of sink when streaming. And sometimes when playing games it gets stuck on the last controller imput so you can end up spinning in circles or something. We are a heavy gaming house and have the best internet available in the area and don't have those issues on other tvs whether streaming or gaming on a console, so not sure if it's a server issue or just too much bandwidth being used yet. Could also be the TV upscaleing the source to 4k if the content isn't 4k native. TV is hardwired straight off the router. The Remote is fantastically simple. Center stand is nicely heavy if you don't want to wall mount it and supports the tv well. But again the picture is just wow.

"I've had this thing for a week or so now and I am extremely happy with it. Picture is truly stunning, with very black blacks and gorgeous colors. And I haven't made any adjustments. This being my first QLED it took some getting used to. The clarity of the picture makes everything look very different from any TV I've ever had. I watch a lot of Star Trek, and even the original series looks incredible on this thing.

Sound is more than adequate with the built in speakers.

The only drawback is that the Philo network is not an available built in app. But I got a cheap Roku stick and that solved that problem. The center pedestal is ideal for my situation. I have it on a cabinet, and I was able to angle it for maximum viewing which I wouldn't have been able to do with legs on either side.

I went to Best Buy to try to figure out what to get, and of course I fell in love with the new OLEDs. But this was half the price of the cheapest OLED, and I am so happy I decided to go this way instead.",B09TQ46KJL,Excellent quality for a great price,Size: 50 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars

"Overall, this is a pretty good TV. Picture quality is good, and the smart features are decent if you are interested in that stuff, the built in speakers have great range, and I really like the rechargeable remote.

Two main issues are popping up in the month I’ve had this TV:

1-Recognizing connected devices. When I first plugged an Xbox and a Nintendo Switch into the TV, it recognizes them and even gave a custom icon. Unexpected, but a cool feature. Strangely, it didn’t recognize a PlayStation at all. After a couple days, I moved things around, and had to disconnect and reconnect different components. This time, it didn’t automatically recognize anything and hasn’t since. Even though all the devices were plugged right back in the same configuration, even after attempted a firmware update, then a factory reset, but still nothing. Weird, but not a deal breaker.

2-Audio issues. The thing that would keep me from recommending this TV to anyone is the intermittent audio issues. A couple days after using the tv with no problems, the audio randomly cut out/ skipped every few seconds. Messed with different setting in the menus, updated firmware. No luck. Reset to factory settings, it worked fine for a few week. But they just started up again a few days ago. Doesn’t seem to be tied to any specific device or streaming service, just random.

"alexa is a bit hit or miss. amazon was supposed to do unboxibg and setup,but only did a partial unbox. i had to have a friend come over to help me get it on a table so i could install the base and then move it to the stand. i had remove many apps from main menu i didnt want. the tv was surprisingly heavy compared to my 70 inch vizio. i attribute this to the quality of the front glass. i really like the center stand compared to the two seperate legs on either side.",B09TQ46KJL,This TV is super clear!,Size: 85Style: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars

"I have a 66-inch version of this TV, which I absolutely LOVE. SO when my mother's TV went on the fritz, I recommended this smaller one for her. BIG MISTAKE. While I primarily stream my content, she relies on mostly broadcast TV and the absence of a numerical channel changer along with ""memory"" for switching back and forth to recent channels is proving to be very frustrating for her. This, along with some compatibility issues and complications that arose from connecting the TV to the internal cable network of the housing community in which she lives mad me feel very regretful about the choice.

So, if you are a big steamer, then this TV with its built-in ROKU is fantastic. But if you are still a fan of conventional on-air TV, while this TV can do the job, there are more user-friendly options out there.",B088S3V3R4,Very poor sound quality,Material Type: Back Cracker -07,4.0 out of 5 stars

"So for one it has a blue tint to it and there's no real way to a adjust the blue, they give you a red and the green adjustment but no blue adjustment and of course all the whites have a blue tint. The remote control is pretty terrible, you often have to push the button two or three times before it registers, plus just say you're fast forwarding something and then you hit the play button sometimes it just gives you a black screen and you have to do a couple more clicks on the fast forward and hit play again to get it to work. The processor seems very slow

Now I've been using Roku for a long time but I've always had the little box that you plug into your TV and those things are awesome,. This particular Roku tv, not so much. I was reading an article about this television brand and how much time they spent on like research and development and making sure they make a quality product, I don't know about this thing, my last TV was probably about 13 years old and everything about it was so much nicer than this,. It was not a smart TV but like I said I just plugged a little Roku player into it and that pretty much turned it into one.

Now if you can get past the blue tint on a white screen the picture quality is pretty decent except for let's just say I stand up and I move a little to the left or a little to the right it starts to look a bit washed out which I've never seen a TV do befor, not a very good IPS panel I guess.

I guess for the $150 I can't complain too much, my last TV was probably about $120 and like I said it was old and way better than this, but this has one thing going forward and only weighs about 8 pounds and that other TV was probably like 20 of some pounds,. I was amazed at how little this weighed.

So the question is how long will this TV last, even though I don't love it, if it lasts me a while and the remote control doesn't start acting up any worse than it is already then I guess I'll be happy enough with it, it was cheap compared to other TVs and I'm not one of those people that has to have amazing picture quality I just want decent picture quality but that blue tint bothers me, the processor seems a little slow that bothers me and the remote control doesn't work very well sometimes which bothers me but I don't know, it should do just fine as long as it doesn't break down on me anytime soon",B088S3V3R4,great quality for the price,Size: 75-inch,4.0 out of 5 stars

"So first of i apologize for this long read, but if youre here to contemplate buying a cheap vizeo or and even more exoensive higher end tv like I was, then i hope this can give u some persoective in making your decision, if you've done any shopping around for samaung tvs, you know that this is more of the entry way into the nicer samsung displays. With that being said, after having it for a few months, streaming, casting, listening to music, and playing ps4 and switch. I must say, it's an incredible TV. I chose to go samsung as I've always been a samsung fan, but also because even though you can get a much cheaper large display 4k vizio/tlc/hisence. The problem with those, as I've experienced in the past is that they highly cheapest on the processor as the user interface is frustrating slow. Apps fail to load, Netflix finally starts up by the time your nexfl8x and xhill girl needs to go home, internet connection is crap, pixels die in a few months if they didnt already arrive dead, tv freezes as youre trying to put on your favorite streaming app and videos consistently buffer, and the color accurancy is ok at best, and it's a shot in the dark whether or not you're going to recieve a bad apple that will break down in a few months. What I love about this TV is that everything seems quite snappy and quick. Setup was simple through the samsung smart things phone app. Internet seems fast, you can use your phone as a keyboard and remote through the smart things app as well as lunch apps and project your phone and pc screen wirelessly. The picture quality is great even though it's using the lite Quantum upscale 4k processor unlike the bigger bothers of the line, however even when watching a 1080p movie, the upscaling does seem to make it much more detailed and higj res. The TV seems smart enough to always know what input I want it in as I turn on different entertainment systems. The user interface in my opinion is pretty straight forward, and you get free access to samsung tv + which provides a whole bunch of free channels, and for someone who hasn't had cable TV in the last decade or so, it's a nice touch. You also get access to all the typical smart TV apps like Netflix, Disney, hulu, prime, funimation, HBO, youtube, crackle, tubi, apple tv, plex, pandora, AMC, spotify, news apps and a browser and a bunchnof others ive yet to install. But bear in mind this is not a full fledged android tv, so apps are plentiful but limited for sure. However I'm surprised that even with the inclusion of Google assistant, I'm unable to cast whatever I want to the TV, besides YouTube and Netflix and other apps that are already included with casting capabilities on the tv, so I had to get a chrome cast to cast my own things.... or maybe im just dumb and iverlooked something. One cool thing though is if u have an android (not sure about iphone), you can control almost everything from the smart things app and project your phone onto the screen and even have multiple things on the screen at a time including your ohine screen as you watch netflix to the other side. For ios users apple airplay is built in. And the integrated alexa/Google assistant/smartthings can be used to control any smart devices u have in your home - smartt lights, robot vaccums, nest thermostats, smart switches and all other alexa/google assistant stuff which is great. As well as getting your phone notifications to show on the tv. And if u have other smart speakers, those can be used control the tv as well.

Now unfortunately for some of the bad. First of all is it's not as pixel clear and bright as it's more expensive order brothers. The viewing radius is good but not great, But by setting the display to dynamic or vivid and the brightness slightly up, it's honestly plenty bright and colorful and clear for me. Second is the built in speakers are okay.... I mean they're not horrible, and can definitely be enjoyable in a smaller area, but there's next to no bass, and voices are a little more pitchy than they should be, so a decent sound bar with a sub will go a long way. Personally i got the samsung HW-650 with DTS virtual x and the included sub woofer for not that much money and it basically as close to a home movie theatre experience now. My least favorite things though is that it only has 3 hdmi inputs, 1 of which is an hdmi eARC port that I use for my sound bar, which leaves me with just 2 hdmi ports. Perhaps thats more than enough for you, but with a few gaming systems and a sound bar ive already ran through all of them, however you can find high quality cheap hdmi port splitters right here on Amazon so no big deal but still, and luckily my Samsung soundbar has an extra hdmi port that can be accessed through the TV. My last and final gripe I should say is the remote. At first I actually really liked how small and simple and compact it is, it even can charge through solar or USB c. But overtime youll realize that sometimes having more buttons is better as you just end up having to click more buttons to get things done, like changing the input source, opening the settings, finding your apps, and typing in channel numbers. though the alexa/Google assistant functionality does fill in some gaps for sure.

Overall I'm thrilled I went with this model despite being able to afford the higher end ones. Sure go for it if you wish, but i would say this will surely suffice you, and you might save enough money to get an even larger tv or better sound system, maybe even a second tv for your room or something.

Last thing, I saw some comments about the refresh rate of this tv being just 60hz, however according to the official samsung listing of this exact model, it should be 120hz. I've yet to plug in my how powered gaming pc to test this limit for myself, but just food for thought",B093CP66L7,Not super great,Size: 50-inch,5.0 out of 5 stars
"This TV is amazing, AMAZING!
First I purchased the Samsung 65” 4K QLED for my bedroom, several months ago and absolutely love it so, I just bought the Same Samsung 4K QLED but, in 75”, for my LivingRoom.
This TV is not only HUGE but, the picture is just so incredible that I would have to say,
Mind Blown, Mic Drop.
Who thought we’d own TV’s of this size in our homes when, growing up, if you had a 26” Sony, you were the coolest family on the block.
I can’t believe how truly affordable these are, yes, I caught both on sale plus, I have 2 Samsung Sound Bars with Subs for each and I’m truly in heaven, again Mind Blowing Picture Size and Unreal 4K Quality in QLED and the Sound with the Soundbar with Sub is just a wonderful, movie theater-ish experience that is a “must have” in today’s world of true Home Theater.
Just a side note, since this is turning into. Novel, I plan to upgrade both my Soundbars and Subs to the Klipsch 600 w/surround speakers as soon as I catch a sale (never listen to these speakers at a store as it will make you so unhappy when you listen to what you already have or anything else and honestly, I was so super happy with the sound from my Samsung Soundbar setup).
Damn Klipsch for being the Best Sound and the Big Electronics Store for allowing me to hear them, even though I specifically went to that store with the sole intention of hearing the Klipsch system before I would buy them from Amazon.
There’s a Huge Difference, I mean Huge Difference from UHD (which I had in the 65” and replaced with a 65” QLED) and QLED, which you see immediately and if you can spend the extra bucks to get QLED, you’ll never regret it, I still can’t believe the difference as I had both a 65” UHD & 65” QLED in my home at the same time and it drove me crazy so, I had to get another QLED ergo this 75” QLED.
I bought the 3 year warranty and before you call me a fool/sucker, I will tell you exactly why it’s so very much worth it.
What no one tells you (yet you can easily find out if you do a little research) all these Flat Screen TV are considered “Disposable”, to be replaced every 5-7 years as there’s little to near nothing that is fixable or worth the money to fix, that’s a biggie.
I actually sold TV’s and other electronics a very long time ago and back then it was mostly a total scam but, not now.
I’ve had 2 Flat Screens go out on me in the last 6 years and prices back then were much much higher.
My 65” 1080P highest HiDef TV at the time (only $3,000.00 for a 42” LED), well it blew out, died, had a seizure, something or other and it was just out of warranty by only 3 months (of course).
I tried everything, called everyone, started off really nice, tried bribing people and eventually went to yelling, cursing hey, Im a New Yorker (that’s a Nu Yawka who lived On Lawn Guyland okay😎lol) and got nowhere, nothing Fougeddabouddit.
Finally I was offering to pay a repairman out of pocket but, he told me it just wasn’t worth it.
My High Definition LCD Flat Screen went out with the trash (you don’t want to tell the wife that story because you know she was against it, never needed or wanted a big TV in “Her House! we’ll get back to “Her House” later”.
I replaced that TV with a 65” 4K UHD TV but, this time I bought the 3 year warranty and wouldn’t you know it, at the very beginning of the second year(isn’t it funny how everything always works great until 12 seconds after the warranty runs out), the screen started to really mess up, there were streaks of light, bright dots and stars, it was just too annoying to watch, especially since our TV’s are now a major part of the home decor.
In today’s living room, it’s become the key focal point and the main attraction for which the TV is front and center, then we adjust all the furniture around it.
Of course I called the Extended Warranty Company btw & fyi a little heads up so it’ll make sense or not, I’m a New Yorker so, I was already for a fight before anything started, it’s always going to be something and then an argument.
I explained the problem bla bla bla and the service rep explained that I was out of the manufacturer’s warranty so, I was correct to contact them but, this was a problem that they were already very familiar with and unfortunately it’s not a fixable problem.
Okay, Here we go, my blood pressure is already rising as I’m waiting to find out how I was scammed.
First the Service Rep apologized for it not being a repairable problem and immediately asked when the could Schedule the appointment to pick up my broken TV and bring me a Brand New One, a time that would be convenient for me.
Wait, did I hear that correctly, what’s the catch?
I asked he to repeat what he said and also to let me know how much out of pocket it was going to cost me for a New TV, that I think he just said, they are bringing me to replace my 2 years old broken TV?
Long story short, they delivered a Newer Model as mine was discontinued, they apologized again (poor me they upgraded my broken TV for a newer model, I think I’ll live) and it cost me absolutely zip, zero, zilc, nada, NOTHING!!!
I couldn’t wait to tell the Wife this story as I am going to exaggerate, embellish and make up a story of how I had to fight them to get this Newer Model and I wasn’t going to pay them a penny (come on, every guy does this, we all want to be the hero in our wives eyes).
It didn’t matter because during this whole fiasco, it turned out the wife was defective too and like she said, the TV was my idea so, I got the New Newer TV for free all for myself and she didn’t get it (of course she got the House, Cars, the Dogs, basically everything but, the TV and Almost All Of My Money for the next too many years, that’s a divorce in New York, it’s all about the ladies and I’m okay with that but, this is about a TV & the Extended Warranty and I got both!!!).

The Moral of this Looong Story,
The Samsung QLED is a wonderful thing to have in your house, just incredible, nothing comes close (there’s the 8K, it’s better but, if you had the big bucks that 8K TV’s go for, why would you still be reading this?) plus, if you add a Soundbar and Sub, now or later, Chances are you are going to love watching movies at home more than going out, driving to the theater, looking for parking, waiting online to pay ridiculous ticket prices just before you get robbed at the snack bar and don’t forget the super large cup of ice with a splash of soda and your $6.00 stale candy bar , garbage pail of the saltiest popcorn that’s guaranteed to get you the new high score on the free CVS Blood Pressure Machine, don’t forget your “Fake Butter Flavoring”, now you’re already to sit with a bunch noisy nosey of strangers, trying to calculate how the bill for the overpriced snacks were more than the overpriced tickets yet, still unable to stop thinking about why your feet are stuck to those gross floors.
Hey, some people just love that theater experience,
I think a nice bright 4K QLED in my own hone with a nice sound system, my couch, my new future ex at my side, our own fresh junk food, no strangers annoying us and the best part,
Pause for a quick bathroom break plus,
Rewind anything you didn’t hear or want to see it again.
I will pick Home Theater with my
75” Samsung QLED every time (okay some movies should be seen in a theater but, that’s for you to decide, I’m staying home!)

" First off, I want to dispell any bad reviews you may read about this TV. The people who wrote them simply don't know how to do an ""Expert Setup"" on their TV. They obviously think it's ""Plug n' Play"" and that is NOT the case with any TV, not just this one.

All TV's are setup at the factory and are set at neutral settings across the board throughout the TV's range. You MUST know how to properly adjust each individual setting to optimize the picture quality!!

These settings are located under >Settings>Picture>Expert Settings, on the TV's menu. Don't be afraid to make some mistakes, this is how I learned! You can always hit factory reset and yes, start all over again!!

I know how to do this, I'm very experienced on tweaking TV's. Not to scare anyone, but this one took me the better part of 4 days to fine tune, but man, was it time well spent!!

I scanned different channels, waited patiently for facial close-ups, making adjustments, and basically got a good sampling of all types of TV viewing. Doing this, eliminates the need to make minor adjustments with certain programs occasionally.

I'm very discerning and picky when it comes to a TV's picture quality. Remember, this is only a one-time fine tuning!! Getting this picky only happens once, it won't be a constant hassle during your TV's lifespan.

I have dialed in this TV so well, it's like looking out my picture window at real life action, live. In some scenes the people look lifesize!! Wild!!

To the average viewer, you may not want to go as far as I did fine tuning your TV, but if you really want to experience the extreme level of excellence that this TV is most definitely capable of, you will find the time to take my advice and just do it!!

I bought the 75 inch screen and mounted it on my living room wall like the masterpiece it is! I'm a firm Samsung believer, their quality and technology is top-notch and world-class!!

I bought a full-motion wall mount for my installation. It's rated for TV's up to 130lbs. With a full-motion mount, it makes connecting cables very easy. Just pull it out from the wall and turn it to the left, that's where the USB/HDMI ports are. You can easily get behind the TV by doing this.

If you need more USB/HDMI ports than are provided, there are 3, you can buy splitter hubs to turn one port into 2, 3 or more. Just be sure they are 4K splitters.

Additionally, I recommend using a Bi-Directional splitter. It allows to either ""input one"" port, in to ""2 output ports,"" or reverse it to ""2 input ports,"" to ""one output port."". (Depending on your specific needs.) These types of splitters are used for connecting other components to your TV. A button on top of the splitter allows you to switch between TV mode, to Blu-ray player or DVR etc.

Note: If you're going to mount your TV on a wall, be sure to use a stud-finder to locate the wall studs. DO NOT mount your TV onto just drywall or paneling alone. My wall is thick pine paneling, drywall, and concrete block behind that.

I used a 8"" concrete drill bit and lag-bolted the mount with lead concrete anchors, directly into solid concrete. It's not going anywhere anytime soon!!

I also bought a wireless keyboard and mouse so I can easily access the TV's internet capabilities. With Alexa included, I just say into the voice remote, ""Alexa, open the internet."" And she opens it to my home page.

This is just one example of what Alexa can do, the list is seemingly endless. If you have other smart devices in your home, they can be programmed into this TV and controlled by using Alexa as well.

As I write this review I am watching my big-screen as you would a computer monitor or smartphone screen and I have the Pandora music app pumping my favorite music thru my home stereo in the background.

For me, this online multi-combination is great for reading/writing emails, playing on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc, paying bills, shopping or just browsing the web.

And I would be remiss if I forgot to mention the voice remote!!

No more batteries to change out! This remote has an indoor solar panel on the back! Bout time someone thought of that! It also has USB charging if you prefer. Its slim design is simple to use and easy to learn.

I am simply blown away with this TV! I have it wired into my 1,000 watt per channel home stereo and I'm so glad I live in a cinder block house, not a glass one!! I'm waiting for the day I accidently blowout my picture window!!

The combination of the big-screen and my sound system is like sitting front and center at the movie theater. Extremely impressive!

For the price, (It was $1497 at the time I purchased this 2021 model,) this TV is an amazing deal if you can't afford the upper class models, such as the Q70's, Q80's or Q90's.

One hint for the not so tech savvy. You MUST upgrade your cable box/satellite service to 4K. This TV won't give you a 4K picture thru a cable or satellite box unless you do. Then check your cable box settings to make sure it configures correctly at boot-up and is set to 4K resolution.

This upgrade should include using 4K HDR HDMI cables, NOT standard HDMI cables. So consult your cable or satellite service for what you will need to receive a true 4K (3840X2160) UHD picture.

One other hint: Double-check your cable box video setting to be sure it configures correctly! Some boxes, even though 4K, will default to standard HD (1080P) or even 720P. If this is the case with yours, scroll to the 2160P setting and lock your picture into 4K.

I have deep, rich blacks and bright, vivid colors that explode off the screen and come to life with true to life flesh tones as well. This is the result of the HDR (High Dynamic Range.) Simply put, it enhances brightness, contrast and color levels significantly.

I can actually tell the difference between a person in a black suit and a person in a very dark blue one! This tells me my brightness, contrast and color levels are set perfectly.

Please don't judge this TV's picture quality by my cellphone pictures and short video! They truly don't do this TV justice. You have to see it in person, and just take my word for it that it's just absolutely incredible!

All in all, I am extremely happy with this purchase, and I am sure if you know what you're doing, you can set it up perfectly to your liking. Or if you can't, ask a techie friend you may have, we all know one or two!!

Just a quick note: I noticed that it appears that this comment page lists posts from owners with a wide range of TV models and sizes.

For the record, I am experiencing outstanding results as I just described with the SAMSUNG 75-Inch Class QLED Q60A Series - 4K UHD Dual LED Quantum HDR Smart TV with Alexa Built-in (QN75Q60AAFXZA, 2021 Model)

I can't speak to any other models. I hope your choice is as good as mine was!!

Good luck!

"I purchased this Samsung to upgrade our small family room's media setup. The value for the price is excellent.

I have read several reviews for TV with a wide variety of opinions on it. Seems like a lot of them are by customers looking for elite quality products at lower end price and are disappointed that it didn't meet expectations. In my opinion this is a quality product.

First let's talk about the TV itself. The manufacturers box was delivered with minimal denting to the box. Obviously with a 50 inch flat panel it's difficult to find a shipping box for it so I was prepared for any normal shipping bumps and bruises. The package itself was light enough that my 8 yr old could bring it in with zero issues. Removing the TV from the box and accompanying Styrofoam, I was shocked by how thin it was. You could mount this on the wall and it would be on par with hanging pucture frames.

The initial setup was fast and easy. Plug in the power, use the three HDMI spots to hook up your devices and let the setup search for channels. I chose to hardwire mine to my home network using an unmanaged switch because we have a lot of wifi devices running in the house and the demand on the network isn't getting any lower. I don't typically gush over remotes but I will this time. It's small light weight and features a rechargeable battery using solar power or charging port. That's right I said solar, flip this thing over in the light and let it do its thing. It also can be used to control other devices with no problem. There is a bit of a learning curve on using it but it can be quickly mastered.

The picture quality is insane. I bought a couple of 4k HDMI cables to try out just how clear the picture could be. During football season I watched a few games on high definition channels and the quality was almost to good and when they switched to high-def cameras during the broadcast it seemed like I was playing a game. I streamed several NHL hockey games and it was like attending a game. I haven't purchased a 4K UHD bluray player yet so I used my Xbox one to try out how it works as 4k player. I had ordered each Star Wars movie in 4k to try them out. The quality was so good it began to approach the level of looking fake. The sharpness and detail during space scenes made it look like models in a special effects shot. In close ups you can actually see the slightest scar or blemish on an actors face. Almost makes you want to lower the quality just to suspend disbelief for a movie.

As far as using it for gaming again it just shines. Switching from a 10 year old flat panel to the Samsung 50 inch was like the difference between the original NES and Playstation 5. Playing my sports game was almost like a real broadcast. My kids played Call of Duty WWII and the storming of Omaha Beach was like watching Saving Private Ryan's opening sequence. Almost no lag and the backgrounds were excellent. It's a great gaming experience.

Odds and ends: I paired a soundbar with it via Bluetooth and had no problems and great sound. The remote even automatically programed itself to control the speaker. There are some different settings that work with to change your viewing experience but I haven't dived into them fully. The smart TV apps seem to work flawlessly when linked to my Netflix and Amazon prime accounts but I use another device for those as well so haven't tested them fully.

All in all if you are looking for a mid-teir TV this fits the bill in every way. If you are a serious videophile or audiophile than this will probably be solid but not what you are looking for. For your 2nd, third, or even fourth setup in your home it will do the job nicely.",B093CP66L7,Tv,Size: 43 inchesStyle: Google TV,3.0 out of 5 stars
"This review is for the 32"" model QN32Q60AAFXZA. I was looking for a 32"" screen with HDR for mixed use as a PC monitor and TV in my garage while exercising on my elliptical trainer. I wasn't sure if getting a TV or 4K HDR monitor was the way to go since TVs tend to render text poorly, while monitors render HDR poorly. I have a PC and a Amazon FireTV stick hooked to a HDMI switcher connected to the screen and so I did not care for smart features.

I tried out both the QN32Q60AAFXZA and the LG 32UL500-W 32"" HDR 4K monitor (which is actually better than its successor LG 32UN500-W model). I have an LG OLED and so deeper blacks is something I am sensitive to and care deeply about. TL;DR, the Samsung won with distinctly darker blacks and punchier contrast, while maintaining very good text clarity for PC and so I ended up ponying $200 more for the Samsung over the LG.

Comparing the rtings reviews of both of these, the Samsung has 50% more contrast ratio (Samsung's 4,653:1 vs. LG's 2,883:1) and ~200 nits higher brightness (HDR Real Scene: Samsung's 468 cd/m2 vs. LG's 242 cd/m2) which shows. However, Samsung's 32"" screen size differs from other sizes in that it doesn't come with dual LED. This appears to reduce both color accuracy and brightness by 5~10% compared to other models from what I read online. What was surprising was that rtings stated better viewing angles on the LG (6.6 avg score vs. 5.7 score of the samsung's) but it was the reverse in my experience. The LG's screen felt more washed out as I moved around even small amounts that I did not experience with the Samsung. I do not do color sensitive work, and so I did not evaluate color accuracy where the LG might have a lead. As far as PC use is concerned, it is good.

The HDR performance on the Samsung is still subpar, with content needing high brightness (like metallic objects) unable to really standout (e.g. like the coronation scene in ""Gods of Egypt"", and the golden threads in the circus scenes in the ""The Greatest Showman""). rtings stated as much and apparently you need 600+ nits of brightness to get that. But for normally lit scenes, everything looks fantastic. However, to keep things in perspective, even my Vizio 40"" (V405-H9) which costs nearly half the Samsung has a higher contrast ratio and looks better in HDR in my darker room. Goes on to emphasize that if you are flexible and can go with larger TV sizes (esp. 55"") then far better options really open up.

The Samsung is noticeably more compact in size (perhaps 1/2"" smaller in all directions) and the power supply is built into the TV (with a paltry 4 foot power cord), while the LG has a bulky external power supply. I use a 3rd party 100mm VESA mount and so I didn't try out the stands. Samsung requires registration to do anything useful with it, but if you simply need to use a HDMI input, you can actually do that with just the basic setup - no need to put it on the internet or sign up for a Samsung account. Also you can use your smart phone as a remote and skip the included remote which has a weird solar based charging and non-intuitive buttons. Its best to skip Samsung's ecosystem entirely and invest in a Fire TV 4K stick, Google TV, or a Roku 4K stick.

I like a touch of vivid (i.e., not color accurate) without it being too obnoxious like in the Dynamic picture mode - these are the settings that I preferred on the Samsung. Once I set these, I then tweaked the color settings in windows to improve the PC contrast and colors without affecting TV watching - unfortunately there are no user saved profiles that you can save and switch easily:

"Where to begin? After spending several weeks researching options to upgrade our old 42"" Vizio (model E422VLE) I decided on the Q60A 55"" and was very excited to surprise my wife with the upgrade. To keep things neat and tidy, let's break it down.

Delivery:
Amazon did a great job here. I scheduled it for the earliest available slot (6:30 AM to 9:30 AM) it arrived right around 6:45 AM. Box was in perfect condition, and the delivery driver helped carry the unit into the house.

Unboxing:
Samsung really thought this through as well. After cutting the straps, you can open the top of the box for the accessories, and then simply slide off the main/upper portion of the box to get to the television. Instructions were clear and easy to read, and the feet easy to install and adjust without tools.

Design:
The overall design of this TV is fantastic. I honestly like it more than many higher end options. The top and side bezels are not only nice and thin, but also a nice matte finish. So you don't have to worry about any strange glare or reflections along the borders (my biggest gripe with the Vizio, which had monstrous, glossy bezels). The offset logo is also a nice touch in reducing potential distractions, and it has a downward firing red light when powered off, which shouldn't cause any sleeping issues if this unit is in a bedroom. Oh, and thin! This TV is beautifully thin.

As a side note: ATTENTIONAL ALL INDUSTRIAL DESIGNERS! Please, PLEASE stop using gloss black on the front-facing surround of screens. It makes no sense and is needlessly distracting. Yes, I know it's supposed to look and feel ""premium"", but it just attracts glare, dust, and toddler fingerprints. Have some fun with matte finishes, different tones of gray, frosted glass or other materials, whatever. But no more gloss on the front, OK?

Setup:
I didn't have a Samsung account yet, so I went ahead and got that going. The authentication text messages seemed to have quite a bit of lag, but once the account was authorized it was pretty simple to to get the TV setup with my cell phone and the SmartThings app.

Interface:
In general, I liked the interface. It was simple, easy to navigate, and nice and snappy. No lag whatsoever. I did notice some ads for service like HBO Max but this doesn't really bother me since the vast majority of our TV use is through a 4K Apple TV.

Picture:
Wow. Just... WOW! Coming from the 1080p Vizio (which was honestly a fine TV for being 10 years old, just not 4K) I'm sure most 4K TV's would have been impressive. Even so, I feel like I can honestly say the straight-out-of-the-box picture was gorgeous. I didn't fiddle with any picture settings. The colors popped without being overly saturated, and the blacks felt plenty dark. All in all it just looked great. I did notice there was some small, lightly darker spots in both lower corners, and when looking again at the display units at Best Buy noticed it was on their unit as well. It's not terrible, and on any movies with even minimal letterboxing (like Luca) you won't even notice it. But on bright backgrounds without a lot of detail it may distract a bit.

Sound:
Sadly, the sound is where things really started falling apart. I'd read some reviews that the sound was like ""a cell phone in the 90's"" and thought to myself there's no way that could be true. And while it isn't quite that bad, in ""Normal"" mode (the default setting) it certainly sounded severely week and hollow. To the point I couldn't imagine trying to ever listen to anything in that mode. The middle option, ""Adaptive"" was sufficient, though the bass still felt lacking. The new iMac - which is significantly smaller and thinner - has significantly more bass and much, much better audio quality than the Q60A, which is disappointing. But it gets worse...

When using a 4K Apple TV the audio randomly, and frequently cuts out. Sometimes when the next show in a series started to stream, sometimes in the middle of a movie. Stranger still was that the sound in general still worked - if you pushed the back button to browse again you'd hear the navigation effects and chimes without problem - but go back into the movie/show and there wasn't any audio. I tried adjusting audio settings, switching to AirPlay speakers (which would work fine) then back to the TV (still no sound), resetting the TV, and searched the Samsung support forums for answers. Unfortunately it seems like this is a potential issue with this model, and possibly Samsung TV's in general.

What's more, once while in the middle of a movie, the sound muted by itself (the remote was on the stand) for no reason at all. The mute icon just popped up on the screen and stayed that way until I adjusted the volume with the remote. Not an encouraging sign.

I didn't expect spectacular sound, but the combination of what I would call ""just barely adequate sound"" at this price point, combined with the frustration of sound dropping randomly means I'll be sending this unit back. If I decide to try a replacement of the same model I'll be sure to update my review, but for now I can't see giving any more than 2 stars.

Summary:
Amazingly colorful, crisp picture with some very subtle clouding in the lower corners, beautiful and thoughtful industrial design, and a clean, snappy interface. But disappointingly poor sound and unacceptable sound dropping issues. I would highly advise looking & listening to this model in a store first if at all possible.",B093CP66L7,2nd Purchase only Bigger!,Size: 55 inchesStyle: Google TV,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The good: Small screen 32"" 4K resolution TV, with SUPERB AUDIO! Current market very hard to find small screen size 4K TVs, especially with decent audio output.
The VERY bad: Uses Samsung Tizen OS (operating system), NOT Android OS. Means you are LIMITED to streaming apps provided by Samsung. Means you can't install .APK sideload apps. Took forever to figure this out, as most web searches give info on how to sideload apps on Samsung ""smart TVs"", no explanation that Tizen smart TVs are different than all other Samsung Android smart TVs. This would have been a deal breaker if I had known before purchasing this TV, as there are a number of apps I use, including NYRA horse racing app, not available via the LIMITED Samsung app library of 20 or so apps offered. REALLY BAD Samsung decision to use ""TIZEN"" OS, to save $ I assume!

"There are 3 issues. (1) This ""smart"" TV gets confused so easily. I selected Alexa for the voice commands because I have Amazon Fire TV. I use a digital antenna and I also subscribe to a number of streaming services. A few of those services are available through Samsung but not all so I do have to switch to Fire TV for those. When I am using the digital antenna and request a channel number, I can see that it heard the command but it usually does nothing (once in a while it works). I have to manually enter the channel to change to. It also often gets confused when I try to select an app to stream from. I have a smaller older Samsung smart TV and voice commands work incredibly well switching from antenna to Samsung Plus to apps installed through Samsung and Fire TV apps. I am so disappointed in this particular TV.

"This TV was great...until it wasn't. Setup went great and was able to get all my streaming apps loaded and set up. The TV connected to the Samsung sound bar without a hitch.

"I can’t say enough about this tv! I bought a 65 inch from Amazon that had been “renewed” but was “like new”. I knew I was taking a chance, but was encouraged by Amazon’s product guarantee, return policy and terrific price! I ended up saving about 100 bucks for essentially a new product-it even came in the original packaging with everything inside!

I’ve had my tv for about 3 days and have been testing it and learning the different features. Everything works perfectly and it took me about 20 minutes to set up by myself after taking it out of the packaging. If I’d had help, I probably could’ve had it set up in half the time. You should have your internet service connected and a smart phone handy to get through the quick set up steps efficiently. With those 2 things in place, I found the set very easy to do. If you are a gamer or need to connect equipment to the tv ( like a game consul or a DVD player), make sure you have hdmi cords that can handle 4 k high speed connections, to maximize the screen and viewer experience. It does make a difference!

The screen picture is pristine, and the color is vibrant and crisp. It really is amazing to see how much tech has improved from even 5 years ago! I appreciate also that the main streaming platform apps are already downloaded to the Home Screen, and for those apps that aren’t, you can likely download from the App Store on there.

The one thing I wish were better is the remote. It’s easy to use, but it also very limited. You actually allow light to recharge it, rather than using batteries. I hate this because the tv is in my basement family room that doesn’t get much natural light. I suppose I’ll have to leave a light on now to let it charge. So inconvenient. It’s also very slim and small. For a person with large hands, it gets annoying.",B093CP66L7,Easy to operate.,Size: 55 inchesStyle: Google TV,5.0 out of 5 stars

"Right out of the box and on the wall, I loved the picture quality. Sharp, beautiful colors, deep blacks. A real joy to watch programs on. But, to cut to the chase, the sound quality from the built-in speakers is absolutely horrific. There's almost no bass - it's all very tinny treble, and no amount of adjusting the settings can pump up the bass so that there's a natural sound coming out of those speakers. Yes, I've tried everything recommended in online Samsung forums, as this issue seems to be common, but nothing works. Obviously, I could bypass this issue with a sound bar, but there's no place for one in the small space that we have for this TV in our kitchen. I do use Apple HomePod Minis for when I switch to Apple tv streaming, and the sound out of those is great (and they're easy to place on the kitchen counter below the TV), but they can't be used with regular (non-streamed) television viewing.

This is such a shame, as our old LG TV had superb sound from its speakers - deep, rich bass and easy to use settings. I've contacted Samsung about this issue, but received standard replies about how to use the settings to change the sound output. Yes, I know how to do that, even though the controls aren't very intuitive and buried somewhat deep. I'm always amazed at a company that does something so right - like the wonderful picture quality of this TV - and then just falls so short in other areas. Anyway, if you get this TV, you take your chances. I give the picture quality high marks, and the speakers a mere 1 star, so the whole thing averages out to 3 stars. I'm so disappointed.",B093CP66L7,SOME THING YOU SHOULD KNOW BEFORE YOU BUY THIS SAMSUNG TV,Size: 55 inchesStyle: Google TV,5.0 out of 5 stars
"As per others here the viewing angle is very limited, but when you are within it, it is an outstanding picture. The HDR,HDR+ etc, doesn't truly work, mostly because the backlight isn't zoned, and the fact that it doesn't have the dual led backlight. Sound is fine, especially if you have on stand with a hard surface underneath. The speakers down fire so if hung on wall bet they would be extremely tinny. I have it set to film maker mode for all, works fine. Colors are bright and no evidence of banding. The 4k upscaling works really well even with sd format. For our usage this TV fits the space constraints very well, small apartment living room.
The built in software is fine, but slower than our connected roku 4k stick, so we use it instead of the built in smart tv apps. No doubt it would be fine if only thing available, but roku is definitely faster. Since we had it set up with what we needed it was easier just to keep it running. BTW roku remote will control on/off and volume and mute of this tv. Unless we need to change underlying tv settings we don't us the nifty cool solar cell remote, :D The tv does have a higher power usb port which allows the roku to be powered by tv, no wall wart needed. Spectrum app, allowed us to save $8 a month in cable fees, since i could return rented cable box.

"Once again a great Samsung television. Excellent image and minimal physical design. Replacing a 2017 Samsung smart TV (which still works great just doesn’t have direct access to certain streaming channels like MHZ), the improvements are measurable.

Like all new TVs, you might find the factory defaults a little over the top as I do. First thing was to stop motion smoothing so classic movies don’t look like 1950’s TV shows. Turned off dynamic contrast and was good to go.

The automatic integration with other manufacturers’ equipment was a surprise when the TV recognized the cable box, the sound bar and the BluRay player during setup without my input. If the provided remote, was a little more complex it could easily have been a universal remote for all the equipment including the cable box.

The Smart TV menu is a bit more cluttered now and when I tried to customize it, it wouldn’t take unlike the 2017 model. Don’t know why, maybe I’m missing a step. But I have all the streaming channels I want now. YouTube integration is simple. Linking to my iPhone, iPad and computer was simple. My older iPadPro has connection dropouts but my newer phone and computer is flawless over WiFi.

Worth the extra dollars over cheaper flatscreens.",B093CP66L7,Great TV,Size: 55 inchesStyle: Google TV,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I have this television set up in my travel trailer, and it's perfect for it. It would probably also make a great bedroom television. I'm still getting used to the voice remote. It doesn't want to recognize when I name any of the Samsung smart channels, and instead thinks I'm trying to go to a cable or satellite channel, neither of which the travel trailer has. The picture quality is excellent. Others have commented about the sound, but it actually has better sound quality than similar televisions I have owned by other companies. I still got a sound bar for it, because I wanted even better sound quality, but even before I received my sound bar I enjoyed rich sound through the television. I have the 32 inch version, which is the biggest the travel trailer can really handle in the television space.",B093CP66L7,Fantastic picture quality - horrific sound quality,Size: 43 inchesStyle: Google TV,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought this TV to replace a 6 year old Samsung. Very happy with it.
As others have said, if you want the best TV to hook up your $1500 gaming pc to or play the best of the best Xbox series X games on at the highest settings, you can find better tvs (for a lot more money)

But if you want a very good TV to watch sports, streaming, movies and regular shows, this is great.

I'm a bit puzzled as to why others said the TV sound is bad. We have another 4-5 year old TCL tv, and this tv sounds much better. We even have a $200 sound bar hooked up to the old tv....I tried hooking that soundbar up to this TV and it was only a slight improvement over the speakers in the TV.
Of course, buy yourself an expensive soundbar or one with a seperate subwoofer and it will sound better, but this TV for sure sounds better than similar TVs just a couple years old.

The Biggest thing I was concerned about was the Roku smart TV features. We have a Cable app built in (as we did on our old Samsung TV) and it responded VERY slowly on the Samsung. Happy to say it is much quicker on the TV.

In the menu it does have various settings so you can get the picture quality to just how you like it (color temp, color level, brightness/contrast, sharpness, etc) and has a few different sound settings built in also you can change between.

I have bought TV's in the past that I returned because I simply did not like something about them. not this one, this is a very good entry/mid level TV for the price.",B09R6SNNMG,"Only 4k 32"" I could find",Size: 50 inchesStyle: Google TV,5.0 out of 5 stars
"This is our second TCL TV. We bought a 55 inch TCL about four years ago and it has been an outstanding unit. Around the same time we bought a 50 inch Sharp Roku TV that honestly neither of us was ever 100% happy with. It just seemed very unstable and glitchy with the controls and the picture wasn’t that great either.

This TCL arrived in a timely manner the box was perfect and the TV was very easy to unpack and set up. Probably less than 20 minutes. The sound is good the picture is very good.

The one and only thing I would improve relates to the one feature of the Sharp TV that I really did like. There is only one audio out jack which is for headphones. When you plug in headphones the built-in speakers are unenabled. That was one nice feature of the sharp TV, it had a direct audio out and a separate headphone jack so I could listen on my headphones while my wife listened on the speakers because my hearing is not as good as hers. Other than that one thing we are very happy with the TCL unit and would recommend it .",B09R6SNNMG,Bright quality picture,Size: 55 inchesStyle: Google TV,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Might not be the best picture quality available, but it is pretty dang good. If you are upgrading from an older TV (5ys+ old) this picture will be incredible to you. I have recently purchased a 55"" Sony Bravo as well (the connectivity options and sound quality on the Bravo are far better) and when I first got it, I had them side-by-side and honestly thought the TCL had a better picture with my HD cable. Blu-ray, I couldn't see a difference. In short, buy a high quality sound bar (ARC) for this TV and you are still at half the price of the comparably-size Bravo. Fantastic deal. This review will probably upset the electronic snobs out there, but most people don't care that there are 10 picture settings in a TV and aren't going to take the time to switch the setting depending on every viewing situation they are in. I had this delivered and installed through Amazon and couldn't be happier.",B09R6SNNMG,Good delivery as advertised,Size: 43 inchesStyle: Google TV,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Hoping this helps with your decisions.

So, wish we had vid/pic the product to post along with this review. Package was in the simple original carton only. That said, UPS handled it very well as there were zero damage or wear to the carton at all & we gladly accepted the delivery.
The carton gave instructions on how to open the TV the easiest and safest. It was inner wrapped in plastic with an additional thick foam and cardboard shield between the carton and protected screen.
Every item was attached to find easily & no loss or damage.

The set itself is a great economical entry/midrange tv. Picture is on par and the bundled Roku software lends many viewing options. Wireless network setup on TV is easy especially bc we knew our password. Its not clear if any push to connect option was available as we don’t allow that option on our residential wireless. Hardwire network option is available, though our wireless is substantial to hold and serve many endpoints.
Updates were automatically verified and then the Roku app setup begins with simple date time and zipcode verification. If you are familiar it is identical as a external Roku setup. If not familiar, Roku is easy to navigate and select or deselect channels and setup.
You will find 4 HDMI ports one supporting (ARC). If you aren’t familiar with hdmi(arc) devices, suggest you Google else you will miss out on a optional device interface, like controlling a sound bar.
Speaking of sound bar… my only “con” about this set is the rather ‘cheap’ sound it produces by itself. Actually the sound isn’t too bad for a down and back firing sound. I assume the reason for the speaker position is more for wall mounting (not included) and provide a sleek frontal look with a equally 1/2” ‘borderless appearance.
If you plan to use the factory feet/stand just know your lower clearance is around 2” from bottom of set to your counter, tv stand top. Making the audio sound seem a little strange, however you will acclimate to the bass lacking internal sound.
The set itself, it is rather light in comparison to older LCD/LED/Plasma.
A feature beyond a cable box remote controller, enjoyed by our family is the direct ability to adjust volume from the simple Roku remote included.
All in all…this is an excellent value. It’s not a set to ‘crow about up and down the neighborhood, on NFL superbowl weekend HOWEVER you will not be embarrassed by this set in anyway. Kid to the in-laws will love it.

Recommend: Consider a sound bar which are also offered at reasonable $ by same manufacturer & for just this TV model. (So the manufacturer actually knew the sound is anemic and gamble you will have or upgrade with a sound bar…)",B09R6SNNMG,Nice tv,Size: 55 inchesStyle: Google TV,4.0 out of 5 stars

I am also really pleased with Roku. Prior to this I had a smart TV that was not Roku. It really adds a lot of different channels and free apps for infinite things to view. If you have app subscriptions already you can just sign in, it doesn't charge you extra. It also loads really quickly.
As far as regular cable TV I haven't figured out how to pause, rewind, fast forward or any other features yet, which were advertised with the Roku program.

"The TCL roku tv is the best interface on earth for cord cutters. Why? Because once you hook this tv to a good antenna, you will not only get a great picture but a menu. Not just any menu to view what is on tv right now, but a menu to show you what is coming up. TCL is so high tech for cord cutters, by adding a USB drive to the tv you can pause live tv. This is amazing. imagine watching your favorite show but you need a bathroom break. Just press pause and when you come back you can resume. What an amazing free feature. Now if you have internet in your home you will also get free tv channels. At least a hundred free stations that are a part of your guide. Its basically like having basic cable without a monthly fee. The tv will pay for itself in 12 months. About the sound, it is high end sound. You can use headphones and a sound bar but the sound is really good and immersive. About the picture, I suggest you go to sports mode. Go to settings and put it on sports mode because it will be operating in 120 motion mode and the picture quality is great and bright with great contrast. You will get your best picture in sports mode. The best sound is when you go to sound settings and combine the bass with enhanced sound for speech. it is just a button click. In my opinion, if you are a cord cutter a TCL tv has the best combination of features, sound and picture quality. I have owned other brands and still do, but NOTHING compares to a TCL for a true cord cutter. NOTHING! Nothing beats newer tvs because it is made for a cord cutter.

"I’m a week and ½ into the TCL series 4, 65 inch ownership experience. I’m really pleased up to this point.
I replaced a 55 inch LG which simply stopped working. I had been doing research on new flat screens because the LG was acting funny and I wanted to be prepared. I had a ROKU device attached to the LG so the choice of a ROKU TV was a given. I do like the O.S. and user interface.
Pretty plain, but that’s the nature of all flat screens. It’s simple plain plastic frame with nothing taking up screen real estate. There is a button on the front bottom that allows control of the device if you lose the remote. I bought a spare non OEM remote for $5.00, I would recommend it. The remote combined with the ROKU interface has a lot of options in spite of the remote only having a few buttons. I do miss numbers on the remote however.
So the weirdness is the default settings. When I turned it on the initial impression was the screen was not bright and actually kind of flat and boring. After learning all the settings I found one that was set to “low power.” I flipped it to “normal” and a brilliant picture showed up. The same goes for the sound. I set that to theater and a clear more dynamic sound arrived. I don’t know why TCL would set a default to a sub optional setting, but they did. Of course the product literature was of limited value, just had to experiment.

"Upgrading from a 50 inch with this TCL 65 inch was quite a jump. The Room isn't all that big but this 65 inch certainly makes it more like a small theater. Good Quality picture along with all the perks of Roku built in makes it easy to enjoy true 4k media on a big screen.

Only issue I have found is that the built in speakers are sub optimal, you will need to provide better speakers, in order to get good full range sound.

I have used this size for desktop applications for years now and this is just the latest iteration for me. I love the 43in size for productivity as I can have four good sized windows open at any time and quickly move between them. I was worried that my potato of a work provided laptop would not run the 4k screen (and the provided docking station did not) but with some work I got a thunderbolt dock hooked up and was good for the full 4k 60p. I know that this size is not for everyone but for me I looked at a lot of different options even ended up with the 49in ultra wide in my cart at one point but the price of this is unbeatable. You could spend $1000 dollars on an ultrawide or you could get this for less than $400 I mean it is hard to make any other decision really. Now on to how it looks. it is not super bright or extra deep colors but for office work it is perfect in my book. I also own the new 42in oled for home use and it is no comparison the oled thrashes this in every possible metric but it is also nearly three times the price so it better. My only real gripe with these screens is that at arms distance away the corners get a bit soft. This is not a deal breaker but you will find your self shifting to find the close button in the far right corner from time to time. A tiny bit of curve to the panel would solve this but that is a bit of a pipe dream. All in all this is a five star product for the price and I can not recommend this enough for power users that need a little bit of extra space.,B09RSBD9JN,Just Good,Size: 55-InchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars

"I have had this TV a couple of weeks now so I've had time to see how it fits into my life. First of all, I am a 77-year old woman living alone and I was able to set it up completely by myself. The directions were straight forward and easy to follow. The hardest part was putting the feet on because the screws were black and the insertion points were also black. The actual set up of the programming was amazingly easy. Most apps or features I wanted on the Home Screen could be set up using a QR code which then went to your account for features like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Apple TV and others. No complicated setup was required. I really appreciated that!

I love the Home Screen. At first I wasn't sure I'd like it but as I've used it I've come to love that it gives me all kinds of options as soon as I turn it on. I even set it up to give me weather in my area. If I want to go to Netflix or even Apple TV I just click on that option and I'm good to go. If I want to access the Home Screen of my satellite dish provider, I just click on HDMI1 and it takes me there.

There is also a feature that allows you to use Alexa to find things but I haven't done much with that yet. It sounds like it will be fun to explore though.

All in all, I had this TV unboxed, set up and ready to watch in less than an hour. That, to me, is success!",B09RSBD9JN,Menu options ..,Size: 43-Inch,5.0 out of 5 stars

"First thing one should appreciate, is the sheer size of the item. Massive at 65"". The box arrived by Amazon freight at 6:30 am, but it was worth it because I feared it would be left in lobby which is not secure.
The box is massive and quite tall.

Set up requires a minimum 2 able bodied people. The box pops open on the side with some light pressure and the TV is there for all to see. Picture quality is impressive and will show non-HD images well enough with very little pixelation. HD and 4K signals are crystal clear and dynamic.

The remote is easy to navigate and only a little intimidating at first. It is actually set up rather simple, but I can appreciate this. The options on the screen are numerous, but navigating is simple. Take from me a non-technical person on any level.

Connects easily to sound bar with minimal fuss. I got it for cable and movies, so I don't use the Wi-Fi and smart options. It may be a smart TV but I'm a dumb guy, so that's that.

I would recommend the product and the freight was spot on. Was concerned I'd get a tv with cracks or dead spots in screen. This was not the case, and I am grateful. The price point can't be beat, I know because I searched. Amazon has some of the best policies of any company so ordering from them is a no brainer.

"I was trying to order a Samsung TV from their special web site for students & teachers, and had a typo on my first name. They first approved my order, then canceled it because they couldn't verify my credit. I called them and got it resolved, and then tried to re-order but the site still wouldn't take the order. The finance lady said it might take 48 hrs to re-program. I decided to go to Best Buy and look at the TV's while I waited for Samsung to correct the problem. I saw this Sony X90K and the picture between it and the Samsung were miles apart. I went home and ordered it on Amazon and had it in ONE DAY! I am soooo glad I went to look at the TV's in a store.

"I have dreaded ""Smart"" TVs for the last several years but this TV has changed my mind. Everything works so smoothly and nearly out-of-the-box. I use an HDMI cable to my Denon receiver for the ARC audio only and the only change I had to make was to disable Dolby Digital Plus under the TV audio settings. Without any inputting of manufacturer codes or selecting my receiver model or any of that nonsense, the TV remote fully controls the Denon receiver volume and power. One touch of the power button on the remote turns on/off both the TV and the receiver.

The picture color is stunning. I did see a very slight gray clouding in the lower left-center of the TV when during the TV setup wizard and I was concerned. But when watching actual media, the local dimming technology removes all clouding. The dark scenes are great, and the colors and brightness are amazing.",B09R9JMM67,Too soon to rate with accuracy.

"i was very heartbroken after i set up the 55"" tv. it randomly restarted. i loved the picture and the fact that it had a nextgen atsc 3.0 tuner. unfortunately even tho cincinnati channels 5, 9,12, 19 and 64 are broadcasting in 4k i could only get a 1080p picture. sometimes the higher def signals didnt come in at all but i still got the 1080i or 720p atsc 1.0 signal. so my disappointment is that the atsc 3.0 signal is supposedly supposed to be stronger than the atsc 1.0, but that wasnt my experience. but thats not the tv's fault. my main issue was that it restarted constantly. the longest i could go without restarting was about 30 minutes. that was very disappointing.

the other issue was the remote control. with older sony tvs i could get to what i wanted by looking at the remote. here, because there are fewer buttons you have to dig thru the tv menus. id rather scan my remote than look thru menus. the other feature that i didnt like was google tv. id prefer the old sony android set up that did not utilize google tv. it seemed more simpler than google tv trying to push all these streaming services on you.

since i ordered the tv and amazon had it (i did not want one thru one of the 3rd part vendors) the return was very simple. my advice is, if it is available thru amazon avoid the hassle of dealing with a 3rd party vendor and get it thru amazon. so eventually i did get a 48"" sony (xbr-48a9s) that just happened to have android only and was 120hz (but for a ps5 that 120hz feature wasnt available - pretty ironic). i was sad that it didnt have an atsc 3.0 tuner but i figure i can always buy a set top box with the tuner later. but i love my 48"" and so far it has never randomly restarted.

i was going to have amazon replace the 55"" but then i read another review mentioning the same exact problem of it constantly restarting. so i am happy and disappointed with sony at the same time.",B09R9JMM67,Love it!,Size: 65-inchConfiguration: TV only,1.0 out of 5 stars

"Eu sempre tive vontade de conhecer a história original de “O Mágico de Oz”, mas nunca tive o prazer de encontrar uma edição bonita como esta.
No exato momento em que a Darkside anunciou o lançamento deste clássico nas edições “First” e “Esmerald” eu me encantei, não tive dúvidas que as edições eram impecáveis. Resolvi comprar nessa edição “First” por se tratar das cores das ilustrações que contém dentro do livro. A cor que predomina essa edição é o rosa, já na outra edição “Esmerald” é o verde.

"There's only one big issue for me: my room is very compact, I have a lot of stuff so while I have the TV in my room, it's big enough that I have to rearrange my room quite a bit and am actually thinking of trying to get a smaller size if possible, there's nothing wrong with it, it's me who is the issue here.

So for starters on the pros:
- Timer that can be set, so if you're like me and like to have noise in the background while you attempt going to sleep, you can set it for 10 minutes, 30 minutes, an hour, etc.

- Built-in apps such as Prime Video, HBOMax, Disney+, Vudu, YouTube, Paramount+ and FreeTv (which is just mostly random channels based off topics from Tosh.o, Kids channel, Sports, Old Cinema films, roughly something for everyone

- Custom Presets to your liking: meaning that if you change the brightness to a certain type, change the gamma, the ratio, and so on, you can make that a preset and just switch to that whenever, otherwise there are modes like Sports, Gaming, and Movie that will change the brightness and screen display

- Fairly good sound system, you can have some noise suppression, I have it in my room with the door closed so personally doesn't bother me, but to each their own right?

(Unfortunately I'm not the best person to give off specs so these are just what I like about it, sorry)

Cons: fairly large TV mainly, mostly meant for a living room where you can watch Friends in a group and laugh at the antics of Ross being on a break.

I hope you enjoy the TV for what it is, it's an astounding experience from the delightful company that is Vizio, I've rarely ever had a bad product from them, so if I can I'll do my best to see about getting one for a better decent size for me.",B094MZL6R1,Very good for the price,Size: 43 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Arrived by big truck at 7:15 am. I let it warm up to room temperature to it pack it. It took two of us to unpack and set on the stand. I’m very pleased with the Quality. The picture and sound are fantastic right out of the box. I chose this particular model for the voice enhancer which when turned on, slightly muted the background noise to bring the voices up louder. You won’t be disappointed!",B094MZL6R1,Disappointed with Picture Quality,Size: 55 inchStyle: TV Only,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Vizio did well with this TV. I feel like the processor could be a bit faster, but I’d probably have to step up to the P series for that. I cannot speak to the sound quality since I use a home theater system, but the incorporates my Apple TV and Onkyo reciever nicely over e-ARC. No major complaints after 3 months of use. This is now the 3rd Vizio TV I’ve purchased in the last 5 years. All are still working as planned.",B094MZL6R1,So far so good,Size: 50 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I enjoy my smart home setup and having devices that work with Alexa, and the fact that this TV says it works with Alexa was a major factor in my purchase. And while the specs say it works with Alexa, that's not quite true.

First off, the instructions that Vizio provides on connecting the TV to Alexa are not correct. In one of the steps you need to register on the Vizio website, but the page that you link to on the Vizio website does not fully load and you cannot register. Instead, I had to download the Vizio SmartCast app and use that to connext. Then you have to set up the Alexa skill within the Alexa app. Go ahead and read the review on that skill - thousands of negative comments and it's rated less than two stars.

I finally got it to partially work. It would turn on and off the TV and open apps, but it could not find anything or control my soundbar volume. I contacted Vizio and they seem confused that their TV was having problems with Alexa, despite the thousands of negative comments. None of their fixes work, and neither did other fixes that I found. Then suddenly, Alexa tells me the TV could not be found and none of the commands worked. I spent 20 minutes connecting the apps, skill, and TV over and over and then got the limited functionality back. 20 minutes later it all stopped working again, despite all of the software being current.

Amazon should de-list this product as being Alexa compatible. It's a joke.

As for the TV, for the $750 or so I paid for the 70"" model it's great, but it's not exactly plug and play. You have to register the TV and download a ton of updates before you can do anything. That took 30 minutes or so. Once I was able to watch the TV, I was not happy with the picture quality and there was a lot of motion blur. But after 20 minutes or so adjusting the settings I'm more than happy with the picture quality, especially for this price. For those that aren't sure on how to tweak the settings, there are a lot of websites out there that can provide you settings.

As a TV it's great. As a smart home device with Alexa it's a failure. Vizio needs to get their act together. From what I found out, this issue has been going on for a long time.",B094MZL6R1,Can't beat for the price,Size: 50 inchStyle: TV Only,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Overall, the TV works well as a TV. Large, good picture quality and sound, great anti-glare, and a good price.

But, there are some issues, mostly with the programming of the smart TV, that would turn me towards something else if I had to do it all over again.

- My biggest complaint is the ads. Being a smart TV, it has a homepage with different apps. The first two rows (taking up about 3/5 of the screen) solely contain ads for movies, streaming services, and miscellaneous products. The cursor always starts on the first row when turned on and doesn't default on your last-selected-app, so you're forced to see and scroll past them. No option to opt-out or turn it off. Additionally, about once every-other-week, you get a full screen ad on startup that you have to back out of, specifically using the ""Back"" button. So no auto-piloting to select your preferred app/input.
- The apps are all preloaded, with no option to add or remove, they are all always visible. I use about 5 streaming services regularly, and this TV comes with 125 at the time of writing. There is no option to hide apps you don't use, which would be relatively easy to implement. Other smart-options, like Roku, only show your downloaded apps, with a store/catalog that allows you to download the ones you would like to add. This is definitely a downgrade from that.

Bugs:
- I currently have speakers plugged into the 3.5mm jack and default to them for audio. When I turn on the TV and begin to watch something, it will play at max volume unless I modify the volume. I've been caught off guard too many times, but has now become part of my regular routine.
- Another volume-bug is that, occasionally, if you tap either of the volume buttons, it may act like you're holding it down, rapidly increasing or decreasing the volume.

Overall, my gripes are just that: gripes. There isn't anything ""wrong"" with the TV (besides the bugs), but the overall design and functionality of its ""smart"" features shows itself as cheap, thoughtless, and money-oriented design over a quality product. This leads me to believe that the TV will no longer function as a smart TV in a couple years, as Vizio moves on to their next product.

Thus, it recieves 3/5 stars. It works and functions well-enough, but the design philosophy is lacking. If you want something that will last 5+ years, look elsewhere.",B094MZL6R1,Nitpick,Size: 75 inchStyle: TV Only,3.0 out of 5 stars
"Leaving aside psychotic A/V junkies, most of us are looking for a solid, reasonably priced TV that will run the apps we want and hook up a sound bar and game system without any issues. This TV does that. I had it out of the box, configured, and up and running within an hour. Note that you may need to configure the HDMI mode to get your PC to recognize the 60Hz refresh rate. Picture looks good, plenty of configuration options, no noticeable lag when gaming. All of that is fine.

The biggest flaw is certainly the dweeby little robot foot legs, which inspire exactly zero confidence. They can be installed at two different heights, which is fine, but a single screw each means the legs can still loosen and shift once they are bearing weight. I had to manually pull each of the legs square once setting the TV down to ensure they were bearing the weight properly. The TV wobbles if I walk by it, and while I don't think it's in any danger of collapsing, the slight forward lean is not ideal. I'll be looking for a solution in the future, but out of the box the included stands are unsatisfactory.",B094MZL6R1,They warned me not to get TCL,Size: 55 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
First one I purchased lost the audio output and was returned for this one of the same model. It also lost it's analog audio output. I phoned factory service and was told by the third person I spoke with (head technician) that this is a common and known problem with many of these tv sets and the factory is aware. The tech claimed a software update in the future may correct the problem yet had no idea of a date. I found the optical output did not have the problem in which a converter was needed to work with my older stereo. Had I known these problems and had I paid attention to the specs I may have purchased another make. The unit ONLY has 3.5mm analog audio output and no RCA jacks. The menu is slow to respond and the wi-fi is weak. I over came these problems with a Firetick. Video blows out bright red color and had to be adjusted down. As a Vizio lover I sadly say there may be other options out there for the price!,B094MZL6R1,Easy to use and set up,Size: 50 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I ordered this television after ordering a TCL 6 series from a third party seller who never shipped the item. Amazon naturally promptly refunded my money. In all honesty, I really had my heart set on the TCL 6 series, but since the TV was for a bedroom, I could not justify the higher cost of the TCL. So, I did what everyone says not to do, I settled for this television. The tv arrived promptly, and Vizio's packaging is really efficient -- they have the TV in a plastic bag which has handles so you can lift it out of the styrofoam.
Set-up was a breeze but did take a little longer than I had expected as Smartcast needed to update. Once that I was finished I went into the picture settings, got them the way that I wanted. The picture quality really did surprise me in a good way. The picture is very impressive -- clear, and I really have no complaints at all about this. I also own a Vizio V series and without hesitation I would recommend that you go with the M over the V! Also to my complete surprise was how good the sound it. Please keep in mind that I have mine in a bedroom, but I was looking at soundbars because I was positive I would need one -- nope, the sound is very good for a bedroom. Any room bigger and you are going to need a sound bar but you already know that.
My only criticism is with the operating system SmartCast. I do not hate it, but I also do not like it if that makes any sense. I wish Vizio would go with Roku or something different than what they have. I am going to keep using SmartCast but if I had purchased a sound bar, I would have went with the Roku so I could also use that operating system.
Overall I am very satisfied with this television and hope this review helps some of you who are considering it.",B094MZL6R1,"Love the TV, hate the remote.",Size: 55 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars

"The TV serves its purpose.
The TV sometimes has issues when I power on? No blockages in front of IR receiver. Auto-wakes with my AppleTV... Even with the AppleTV, sometimes the TV gets hung up on powering on? Maybe I am just impatient.

The picture quality really leaves much to be desired. I know you get what you pay for... But I got a comparable 75"" Vizio TV from a family member a couple years ago (my cat killed the thing) and I felt the colors were a bit more vibrant and the exposure was not so gnarly. But now that I am thinking about it -- maybe I just have to tweak. But I am usually on my AppleTV and it auto switches to ""4K HDR"" when using netflix and half my shows are pixelated on highspeed internet.

Beats me.

I TRIED gaming on here -- but I am so used to playing on my PC... Big screens are just not my thing for gaming. I will say this: PS4 (slim) had some input lag. Very minute but noticeable for me. If you are not playing competitively and are just vibing, go for it.

The antiglare face is nice. The controller is OK. The build is actually nice in my opinion. A nice and heavy TV. I am familiar with Vizio -- so UI is no issue or anything to write home about for me.

"This television has been a mixed bag, some good some terrible.

On the positive side, the television has a great picture. It's nice and bright with good resolution and nice color. We use a sound bar so I can't comment on the internal speakers.

In the so so catagory Vizeo's smart TV interface is okay. It works and will get you to where you want to go but it's much less user friendly than Roku. The main issue is that no matter what you do you can't delete unwanted streaming services from the list and I haven't found an option that will let you add any new streaming channels if what you want isn't on the pre-populated list. You can reorganize the list so that the services you actually use come up first.

And on the terrible side our television simply won't turn on sometimes. I push the power button on the remote and nothing happens. This is a rare intermittent problem. It probably happens one out of every 40 or 50 times we try and turn the television on. I have updated the television's operating system so I know that it's running on the most recent version but this hasnt fixed the problem. I have also tried using the Vizio remote App to see if this will fix the issue still no success. When this problem occurs the only solution that I have found to resolve the issue is to physically remove the television from the power source, wait 10 or so seconds and re-plug in the television.

I would have returned the television but the issue is just infrequent enough that on several occasions I think that the problem has gone away, but then it doesn't turn on and I have to go through the unplug the set thing all over again.

I have purchased several video televisions over the years and have liked all of them, but I would avoid this particular model due to this powering up problem.",B094MZL6R1,Nice picture and great sound,Size: 50 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Enough with the smart TVs already. This is not a direct shot at Vizio but all TV makers. No one wants to use the TV OS system much less have it built in to TV where if it goes out, you can’t even watch anything on external systems like Roku, Fire and Apple TV.

I don’t know anyone outside of people over 65 yrs of age that prefer the TV OS over a Fire stick Roku etc. And even then it’s just because they don’t want to have to switch inputs and worry about multiple remotes etc.

Now on to my problems with THIS TV specifically (Vizio MQ7 70”). I did extensive research and given the limited options in the 70” class there weren’t many great options. 70 is really the sweet spot for my room and I think that goes for a lot of folks so it’s sad to see it abandoned. I read really good things about this TV and seemed to be pretty much the consensus pick for a 70” under $1000.

So I was pretty disappointed in the picture quality when I initially plugged it in and even after messing with picture settings I can’t find the quality I’m looking for. Not to mention a calibration that works for all times of day or night. You pretty much have to have multiple calibrated profiles for different times of the day to get anything close to a crisp picture.

As mentioned above, I do not like Smart TVs. I believe they serve a purpose for a specific consumer group but there should be options w/o an OS I’m never going to use. After less than 2 weeks of moderate use, all the HDMI ports have stopped producing a picture. I have tried every streaming device and anything using an HDMI output in my home and office which I have multiple of each from Apple TV 4Ks, Fiesticks, Roku, Chromecasts and more. Only after performing multiple resets will it come back up and it’s getting worse each day. I fear the point where even that won’t work is coming very soon. I had a TCL Roku tv that became a paperweight when the internal Roku bit the dust but even that lasted almost a year before showing any signs. So I’m more than unhappy that it is happening now within a couple weeks. I’m not even sure how returning a 70” TV to Amazon would work and I’m all but certain it will be a process that is more trouble than it’s worth.

To make matters worse, using the “SmartCast” OS to stream instead of an external device is virtually unusable as each time a new episode or movie turns on, the audio cuts out and you have to back out then restart the app to get audio back on. Sometimes I even have to power cycle the TV. This is the case on every app I’ve used which is a wide variety so it is definitely a hardware issue (or software within the hardware) not the apps themselves.

Really really frustrated and not sure I will ever buy a TV on Amazon again since taking one back to Best Buy and the likes is already a huge pain in the ass much less figuring out how to ship it. Getting 55+ inch screens back in the box is a huge headache in of itself.

Maybe I am expecting too much on picture quality on a sub $1000 tv but I have plenty at my office that cost almost half and blow the picture out of the water. But even then, the HDMI ports rarely working much less going out even once or twice is completely unacceptable at any price poInt in my opinion. Used to love Vizio but I fear this might be the last one I buy. Also has some QC issues on the screen with air bubbling of the glass on the corners out of the box. I fear the air bubbles from a bad adhesive job will only get worse and spread from the corners of the screen they reside currently.",B094MZL6R1,Excellent quality for a great price,Size: 43 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars

"picture is good but I have issues with it dropping connection, needing to unplug to reset, and tv locking up. Many small things are going wrong with the ""brains"" of the tv. picture is very good and no problems but it constantly has small problems. most times the voice remote will lock up the tv, sometimes you can not change the input some times you have no problems, sometimes it says no internet when everything else in the house has internet, sometimes it just moves very slow to different aps. my other smart tvs dont have these issues. This is the third Zivio I have bought in ten years. First lasted five years before it would only show in black and white so we got rid of it and bought my second Vizio which has been a good tv all this time. We needed another TV for the house so I bought this one 6 months ago and now are having many problems with it. Warranty is only for 90 days so I am stuck with it. I wanted very much to like Vizio but with this being the second problem TV out of three, I will not buy another one ever.",B094MZL6R1,"This is an amazing display, colors are so bright",Size: 65 inchStyle: TV Only,3.0 out of 5 stars
Love this unit - so much that I bought a second one for my other home. Vizio’s picture is great and all the built in features surpass other brands - you don’t need Roku with the Vizio and it has tons of built in apps and free content. The remote is simple and the voice feature is nice. It’s easy to adjust/setup and such and I just can’t really say enough about this TV.,B094MZL6R1,Astounding Picture Quality,Size: 55 inchStyle: TV Only,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Bottom-tier performance. Love VRR, hdmi 2.1, eARC, and Dolby Vision feature. What I don’t like is the processing power behind accommodating these features. Latency when enabling/disabling features like Dolby Vision or HDR10 from input devices AND Vizio’s own internal apps which wastes my time and frustrates me. Also dislike that Vizio OS does not give you the option to uninstall those apps you don’t like. Though, I’m sure that’s why it’s so affordable. I still give it 4/5 because of the VRR for gaming and its price, but I really want to give it a 2.5/5.",B094MZL6R1,Looks better than real life!,Size: 50 inchStyle: TV Only,3.0 out of 5 stars
"Mediocre TV. CONS: 1) The dynamic sound adjustment is extremely poorly implemented. Even if you turn off all the sound adjustments/effects/settings on the TV and my Vizio sound bar, the TV still attempts to adjust volume dynamically, which means that quiet portions of movies/shows go completely quiet even when there's supposed to be a little background noise. Then the sound pops back on. It's really noticeable when characters are having a quiet conversation with gaps between speech. Who the hell (forgot to) test basic sound functionality before releasing to production? This defect applies to all input sources and is huge in my opinion. 2) The remote is missing the ""Info"" button, even though referenced in the user manual. This means there's no way to bring up the name of the show when you flip to a broadcast TV channel. 3) There's no aspect ratio adjustment for different input sources, so if you're watching an HDMI input/old movie that's 4:5, the TV will stretch it out to 16:9. 4) The ""active array/dimming zone"" backlight feature is a joke. It can't even keep up with Vizio's own interface animations. For example, when you see a large spinning ""processing"" wheel, you can see the individual blocks of backlight zones turning on and off trying to keep up with the spinning wheel. It actually looks better if you just turn the stupid feature off. I think this ""feature"" is just a cheater way for Vizio to claim higher contrast ratios. SO-SO: 1) The main interface ""SmartCast"" doesn't want to load every so often, requiring a reboot. 2) The mobile remote app looks promising, but doesn't consistently turn on the TV, so you still need the physical remote handy. 3) WatchFree+ has an issue playing adds, where it starts to play the first few seconds of each add, then restarts the add so you hear the first few seconds again. It does this for every...single...add. I'm glad I'm not paying for this service. PROS: AirPlay, the built-in Apple TV and YouTube apps, HDMI inputs (with external Blu-Ray player and eARC-controlled Vizio soundbar), and broadcast TV tuner work well.",B094MZL6R1,Incredible TV With a few Quirks,Size: 70 inchStyle: TV Only,3.0 out of 5 stars
This tv is beautiful for a mid to low price range tv. I didn’t really want a smart tv cause I use my Xbox for everything and plus my internet is terrible cause I’m in a rural area (it’s borderline dial up). This tv will pop up a notification on the screen every 5 minutes or so to remind you that it’s not connected to the internet. That is so annoying when you are trying to play video games. It’s really a nice tv and UHD games look good even tho it can’t handle the full power of the Xbox series x.

"I got to say I love this TV it's looks nice and sounds nice with the vizio 5.1 surround sound speakers. It was well worth it. If your looking for a 4k TV with a great picture this is the TV for you. The only complaint I have is my TV was shipped by a 3rd party company NSD and they took forever to ship it the box was damaged and there is a crack on the back. The TV works fine and I haven't had any issues so far but Amazon needs to part ways from that 3rd party company. They are hard to contact and never give a clear insight on where your TV is located. That is my only complaint.
The TV is great the picture quality is great. My son even games on it with the base model ps4 and the picture even looks better. I haven't hooked my ps5 up to it yet but I bet the picture is just as great if not better.

"Very Happy to receive this TV and I quickly installed in on a Table hooked to a Direct TV receiver and Apple TV box. A few days later I received a Vizio Soundbar for better sound. Before I mounted on the wall, I wanted to play with the settings and get things tuned. First the sound from the TV is OK, not great but I have an open living room with kitchen behind me so needed the Soundbar to raise the sound and increase clarity. All Good so far. First I noticed the TV (even with Performance mode selected) takes nearly 20 seconds to turn on. UGH. Eco mode takes 35 seconds. SLOW. Second with the Soundbar connected, the volume is slow to change- I have it connected via HDMI Arc and not bluetooth and its frustrating. I have a IT background and have installed many components both Computers/TV and other control systems- The settings are spot on. I replaced the HDMI and purchased a high end 8k cable as well and its still slow to change the volume. There are times when you turn on the TV and its blarring noise.. TV Quality is Solid and sharp, its bright and decent look. I've tried another soundbar- no issue but its a cheap one and I need to go back to Vizio as that one filled the room. No Help from Vizio (both products are theirs but they nothing is incorrect in set up)..",B094MZL6R1,Bright enough for a bright room,Size: 65 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I would say find something else, to be honest. Motion handling is only tolerable if you turn off basically every feature to ""enhance the picture"" as you can and even still its jittery even with ideal content. People or things moving horizontally across the screen, for example, aren't smooth with Netflix and Amazon Prime (the two streaming services I use) and 4K external video sources that aren't streaming. Colors are fine... I'm sure I could calibrate this thing, but I'm pleading ignorance right now and thus am happy with the color. I do need it to be brighter, though, because my space is very bright during the day. Unfortunately, turning up the brightness too much washes out the colors (to be expected). If I paid for a higher-end TV, I'd expect it to be brighter... alas, I didn't. My prior TV (a 46"" Samsung I bought in like 2010 that still works) was not any brighter so I guess I'm dead even in that respect. I don't notice any blooming or anything in the real world. I was worried about not having enough ""zones"" but it's fine. Certainly far better blacks than my old Samsung with... 1 zone. I wanted this TV because 65"" is too big for my space, 55"" is more suitable, but this 58"" gives me the extra 3"" I've always wanted. I really, really wish I could customize the smart TV functionality so that I don't have to have all the dang apps installed and showing that I'll never use. That's what's nice about Roku... you can show only what you want to see... because it's MY TV so I should be able to do that! Government really needs to do something about TVs forcing apps on people who pay for said TV, but I digress. Anyway, for now I'll hold onto this TV. It was priced okay and it seems to be good enough for me.",B094MZL6R1,Great for console gaming!,Size: 65 inchStyle: TV Only,2.0 out of 5 stars
"Coming from a 2018 Samsung 58"" to the Vizio Q70a 70"", thought it would be a solid upgrade. In some ways yes - the screen size, the ""smart options"", and with a little tweaking - the picture quality. However that's where it stops and the frustration starts. I mostly use AppleTV + Sonos Beam (using HDMI-eARC). Coming from the Samsung, I thought it would be seamless.

Problems:
1. Turning on the TV, every time, resets the volume to 0 on the surround sound, AND it takes ~15 seconds to activate audio AT ALL.
2. Along same lines, turning on the TV takes like 30 seconds+ to have it working. It turns on, flickers a few times as it activates (and seemingly resets) the HDMI inputs last used. It's really frustrating for a $1000 modern ""Smart"" TV to do this every. single. time.
3. Sometimes the Apple Remote turns on TV, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes the Vizio remote works. Sometimes it doesn't. I've had to call Vizio Customer Service 4x in two weeks to assist.
4. Along same lines, sometimes the volume indicator appears when adjusting. Sometimes it doesn't. There is no Setting to display/hide the volume adjustment. Bit annoying.

Do yourself a favor and spend the extra $100 on a LG, Samsung, or Sony.",B094MZL6R1,This tv rocks!,Size: 65 inchStyle: TV Only,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I got the TV yesterday and after testing with my PS5 I've noticed the picture looks SUPER blurry and almost filtered. My previous TV was also 4K but instead of QLED it was simply LED, and up close and personal the old TV looks marginally better. It almost looks as if this VIZIO TV is not displaying a true 4K image. If the TV itself is actually a much lower resolution and is upscaling the image to 4k I wouldn't be suprised. A true 4K image should be sharp and crisp not blurry and distorted. Which brings me to the grainy aspect of the display, I'm not sure if this is just an HDR thing but the TV also features a very grainy image upon close inspection. Overall pretty disappointing for the price. VIZIO has definitely lost their magic.

"I had old Vizio 47"" tv and it still working great. Wanted a bigger screen so chose this 70"" M70Q7-j03. I loved it as had all the features that I need - Quantum dot, eARC, Dolbi Vision, Local Array Dimming. But it disappointed me up to large extent after I started using and finally has to return it back. Issues were
1) No smooth motion. Even when I set clear motion. I know it is 60Hz tv but still not at par with other 60 hz tvs. Horizontal and vertical movements on screen are horrible.
2) Screen flickers (jitters) some times and sometime won't. My eyes are delicate so was able to catch it easily. Thought if room light bulb might be triggering the flicker so set the light off and also set ambient light setting to off. But it didn't help.
3) Remote Volume button freezes. I guess it is due to tons of apps installed by Vizio and have to way to uninstall it.
4) Didn't get feeling of ownership because all the apps are controlled by Vizio.
5) There's a noticeable lag in getting back to home control after Closing the Amazon Prime or any other app. It's 3-5 sec. Again I blame it to apps and may be the slow processor.
6) I also notice that it plays videos by degrading the video quality. Youtube app installed on tv plays the 4k video to 1080p, 24 frame. Same video from Fire stick tv - Youtube app plays with 2160p, 60 frame. After few days TV was playing the same video correctly. Don't know how this got improved.
7) Many times it failed to connect to HDMI to connect my Firestick tv. Just gets the blank screen.
8) Now this may be too much for few ones but it's real. I can see the Array LED dimming and getting adjusted as the scene changes - specially when shots keeps changing between two persons when they are talking, one had lighter background than other one. Not everyone can notice this but as I mentioned I have delicate eyes to catch every minor details.

Things I like about this TV
Quantum LED - Colors are really good at just 50% setting.
Full Array Local Dimming
Contrast is really good and don't need more than this.
eARC output to audio.

I hope Vizio team reads this. If it was some other brand, I haven't done in this details but don't forget, I am a Vizio fan.",B094MZL6R1,I love it,Size: 70-InchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"My family and friends have had TCL brand Roku TVs and I've always liked the quality of them. This television (TCL Google TV Model 43S446) came up for sale for around $180 during Amazon's Prime Days, so I thought I'd give it a shot even though it's the Google TV software model instead of the Roku TV software.

The Good:
The television was packaged well for good protection during shipment, it was easy to setup, and had good picture and sound quality. It does have a composite (aka: RCA or yellow/red/white) cable input which is nice for hooking up older devices. It is in the form of a 3.5mm jack though, so you'll need an adapter (not included). It has a good antenna TV programming guide (internet connection required), I personally prefer the Roku TV antenna TV programming guide, but this one is still very good.

The Ok:
The Google TV software is easy enough to use, but is much more cluttered than a Roku TV interface. If you prefer a simple, clean looking, easy to use interface, then a Roku TV is a better way to go. As I said, the Google TV software is still easy enough to navigate, and no problem at all for those with sufficient tech experience. Customers in older generations with less tech experience may need more time to get sufficiently acquainted with the menus.

The Bad:
Those familiar with TCL Roku TVs may be fond of the live TV pause feature, which allows you to rewind and/or pause live TV. This feature works very well on Roku TVs. This TCL Google TV has a similar feature, but in my opinion it is too much of a hassle to use. First, you can't simply rewind live TV like you could on a Roku TV, you have to actually pause it first for it to begin recording and to be able to rewind (unlike Roku TVs). So, if you miss something and want to rewind back a few seconds to see it again, you're out of luck. As for the pausing live TV part, the remote itself has no play/pause, fast forward, or rewind buttons. In order to pause live TV you have to go through a settings-like menu, which in my opinion takes far to long to do when you want to quickly pause a show. So, if one of the reasons you want this TV is for the live TV pause feature, don't get it; go with a Roku TV model instead. I considered returning it, because an easy to use live TV pause feature was something I really wanted, but I decided to keep it since it was such a good deal on sale. However....
After about a month of owning the TV, it started to have problems. One morning it wouldn't respond to trying to change the inputs, but that started working again eventually. The same morning, the TV tuner in it seemed to fail. None of the TV (antenna) channels would come in, every channel said ""No Signal"". I confirmed it wasn't an antenna issue or a coax issue. After turning the TV off, unplugging it for a minute, and plugging it back in it seemed to work again. So it may have been a Google TV software issue rather than the actual TV tuner hardware, but I didn't have a way of confirming that. However, TV tuners have been around since essentially the invention of television. Even the newer digital TV tuners have been around since, at least, the late 2000's. Since the technology is well established, that should be one of the last things you have issues with. So, for me, that was the straw that broke the camels back. I didn't want to take the chance of having more issues in the future, so I decided to return it since it was within the return window.",B09JVRW9VY,Easy setup.

- I can't get over how great the colors are on this display
- It is amazing how bright it is, even in a fully lit living room. I have a lot of windows in my living room (it's about 40% windows) and it is so bright that I don't have to close the blinds.
- They are not kidding about OLED TVs and the viewing angle. I can (and frequently do) watch this at an 85+% angle view and it looks as good as when I'm in front.

Setup as very easy to do. I recommend downloading the Samsung app on your phone to make it easier, though this is not required.

My only complaint (but not enough to knock off stars) is that the Alexa integration is a little spotty. Giving commands to Alexa is *not* as good as on a FireTV device, not even close. It can't even handle basic command list pause and play reliably. Also, you can't customize the ""wake word"" away from Alexa so you might have to change your other Echo devices within hearing range.

At first I was actually pretty disappointed because the way the TV ships at default settings doesn't look very good at all. after turning off all power saving settings it made it significantly brighter however it still wasn't what I would consider the most color accurate, the colors are far too vivid so after adjusting all of my settings it looks incredible. QD-OLED is a pretty big step forward.

I was watching a couple high quality movies on this TV as well as my old Samsung NU8000 TV I bought 4-5 years ago and while it is certainly a lot better it definitely made me think reviewers were overhyping this tv just a bit. S95B is maybe 10-20% brighter with much deeper blacks colors really pop as well but I definitely still think my old TV looked good especially for being less than half the price new 5 years ago.

Gaming is pretty incredible as well but be prepare to spend a lot of money on an HDMI cable (I spent $70 on a best buy brand) in order to get all the functionality this tv has to offer, I'm talking about 4k 120hz 12 bit HDR10+ I've played a bit of PS5 games with VRR and it looks and feels pretty good. I've also used my PC with an RTX 3080 Ti and its a pretty decent experience too (once you fiddle with windows and HDR a bit + Nvidia Control Panel as these setting will not be chosen by default) One problem I had that I noticed a lot is how the screen gets cut off which is a tad annoying and distracting, this is actually a setting in panel care that is called pixel shift (it's quite extreme in preventing burn in but because of this its very noticeable)

I've watched a lot of content varying from 480P to 8K on this and the upscaler is fine at 480P but at 1080p and above is where it shines looks far closer to 4K at 1080p and above (Sony wins here imo)

Overall this panel will require a lot of fiddling around in settings and learning this inferior TIZEN OS to get things good but for nearly half the cost of the Sony QD-OLED I cant really complain and still really love this TV. hoping it'll last me at least another 5 years or longer.",B09VHBLV4Y,Sent back,Style: 55-inch,4.0 out of 5 stars
"The picture quality is excellent, and everything you could possibly expect from a QD-OLED. However, Samsung has chosen not to run AndroidTV on this panel for whatever insane reason they may have. This means that several features you might expect from LG or Sony TVs are not here. No Steam Link, limited selection (though it has most) of streaming apps, and no real way to sideload apps (without replacing the OS). Besides that, the OS that is installed is extremely slow at times, and often randomly chooses to swap input sources, or go back to the home screen for no obvious reason. All of this adds up to a pretty poor user experience for what is objectively one of the most visually stunning displays on the market.",B09VHBLV4Y,Good TV/good price!,Style: 55-inch,4.0 out of 5 stars
"The picture quality is good but it is not going to blow your mind if you have seen other high end TV's. The unit I received also had a dead red pixel and some gray uniformity issues. The ABL is very aggressive. Dark content and movies have bright highlights but certain games and other bright content are too dim and there is nothing you can do about it. For example, I was playing Dirt 5 and the overall brightness was totally unacceptable. Way too dim. People complain about DSE, blooming and backlight bleed, etc. on LCD displays but none of those issues are as bad as having the overall display brightness dimmed down to almost nothing. Darker games look amazing. I don't care for Samsung's Tizen OS in general but I do like that you can navigate through the OS on the bottom of the screen while watching content. That's gone on this model. Pressing the home button will boot you out of the app and take you to a full screen home page. I also have to complain about the stand. After sliding the two parts together we had a really hard time getting the screw holes to line up enough to get the screws in. It was very frustrating and was not caused by user error. Basically, I had to push the two parts together with all of my strength to get the holes aligned well enough to thread in the screws. Also the little clips would not open at all. We had to go in with a screwdriver from the other side to pop them out. It was ridiculous and painful on my fingertips. It looked so easy in the ''professional reviews'' I watched. Finally I think the thinness of the TV is actually a disadvantage. It would be cool for wall mounting if the entire TV was paper thin but there is a huge part on the back that is very thick. The TV is only thin (and very flexible) along the sides and top. What is the point? You could easily bend the screen just by handling it and the screen almost looks like it bows slightly when mounted on the stand just from the slight backward tilt. This TV has too many shortcomings to warrant the huge investment in my opinion. Pros and cons. Give and take. The ratio is just about the same as other TV's you could buy for much less. The dead pixel and other defects are not acceptable to me at this price point. The packaging is also terrible. Brittle styrofoam and recycled brown cardboard. Little white pieces of styrofoam all over my living room. Samsung could improve the user experience in so many ways here.",B09VHBLV4Y,It’s great without a cable box many channels.

"I mainly bought this TV for use with my PS5 and Series X and I'm actually impressed. I seriously couldn't be happier. Compared to my last TV which was a 2019 M series Vizio QLED, I'd say this was a huge upgrade for me. That TV had noticeable motion artifacts and motion blur when panning the camera with the right thumbstick but this TV doesn't display any of that! Gaming so far has been smooth and the picture really is nice and sharp. Seeing videos on YouTube about this TV's picture quality doesn't do this tv justice and you have to see it in person to really appreciate it. I could care less about accuracy as I won't be watching too many movies on it but watching some content such as Netflix and Disney Plus has been good. There have been exaggerated claims on this TV saying that it has oversaturated colors but I found if you set the color space in the picture settings to ""auto"" instead of native, you get colors in accordance with the source provided and not to the TVs maximum color capabilities which made the picture a bit better in that aspect. However regardless of the color space settings, do not set the color more than 20-25 (out of 50) as this will prevent over-saturation in colors and give you a more natural look to your picture to whatever the source is. Still have to tweak some settings but so far it's been good. If you're looking for a TV with vibrant colors, deep blacks, high brightness (also in colors), fast response time, low input lag, care less about the accuracy, and just want to game, this is the TV for you I promise. If you're looking for a TV with a more accurate picture and plan to watch tons of movies and TV shows then I'd suggest something else. I highly recommend this TV for the gamers out there console and PC alike. One thing I should note is that my TV came slightly bent which I noticed when I looked on the side of the TV. It's not anything to cry about but still, a little bummed about it. This might of been either a manufacturing issue or mishandling during shipping and transportation. So be careful ordering this TV online with the available delivery options and make sure that the delivery guy or guys are gentle with it when carrying it and unpacking it in your house or apartment. This TV is seriously thin! If you're handling it yourself again be careful.",B09VHBLV4Y,Smart is an overstatement,Style: 50-inch,4.0 out of 5 stars

"The biggest difference I notice in watching a movie in the theater or on this TV is the price of the popcorn (I do have a soundbar with a big ass woofer so I can make my liver shake at home as much as it does in the theater). There could be a bit more detail in the dark scenes, but the S95B is a definite improvement on my C6.

The picture is vivid even during the day in my south-facing family room. At night, when I turn the room lights down and watch the nature shows I love, the picture transports me. The color range is just mind-boggling.

On the negative side, the remote is pathetic. It is rare that I can get it to do anything with just a single button push and sometimes I need more than two or three or four.

I have a 65"" set and paid $500 more than I would have for a similarly sized C2. I'm totally happy with my choice.

UPDATE: The remote went out after a little more than a month. The Samsung support was a disaster. The process that the service people had to follow was idiotic (no the fault of the service people but of some dump Samsung policy). They would not send a replacement remote unless I gave them the serial number of the TV. There was no external tag on the TV that had the serial number. It was available on some menu on the TV. Since the remote was broken, I could not turn on the TV to get to the menu with the serial number. I had to go to a neighbor to borrow a remote so that I could turn on the TV. I got the serial number and they said that it would take about 10 days to get the replacement remote. It arrived today, after about a month. Fortunately, I was able to go online and order a remote that was delivered the next day. Otherwise, I would have had a useless Samsung TV sitting in my family room for the past month. After spending nearly $3K for a TV you'd think that it would be easier for them to get us a replacement remote. I'm just praying that I don't have anything else go wrong with any Samsung product as the customer service is pathetic.",B09VHBLV4Y,Good value,Style: 75-inch,5.0 out of 5 stars

"This TV has excellent quality picture and processing speed for movies, shows, and gaming. The smart TV interface is intuitive and easy to navigate. I can't think of anything it's lacking for someone looking for a really good quality family home theater setup. We were so pleased with our choice.

Then in week two, the wired LAN input failed. I'm pretty tech savvy, and none of the troubleshooting worked. It's just dead. Fortunately, the wireless connection is still functioning until I have time to deal with Samsung support.

Then in week 3, the video source decided to suddenly start changing on its own as we were watching shows. We'd be streaming from an app, and the ""smart tv"" would switch the video source to the Switch through this TV's ""Game Mode"", so now we have to disconnect the HDMI cable from the Switch when it's not in use.

My brother have a TCL and my mom have a FireTV Omni, and they are not that far behind. I am still keeping this TV, hoping it will las at least 10 years, but IMO it doesn't you're paying a premium price for about 5-10% improvement over budget TVs.

"Wow! I’m impressed with the built quality and technological advancement Samsung has to offer with the S95B. Coming from the LG CX OLED TV, I found myself immediately blown away. The produced images are crisp, bright and colorful. Unmatched by current screens in the same arena in my honest opinion. This is true for gaming, watching movies, or enjoying my own recorded footage on Plex. With a screen as bright and vivid as this, Dolby vision is a joke. Streaming movies never looked more intense, lively as this does. I can see clearly people skin tune. Nothing speaks more volume than seeing someone’s face being vividly reflected in a scene of happiness, frustration or anger. It feels good to be able to enjoy my own camping, bicycling, and amateur videos. Makes it worth it.

I’m pleased to report that gaming on this gorgeous screen is a must have. Flames, sparks, and casting spells are on another level. I have been glued on playing my favorite games. Halo, Call of duty hasn’t look this amazing. Can’t wait to play future games coming out this year. Harry potter, Forspoken and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. are all going to be around the corner.

I’m happy with the screen UI and were it currently stands. Initial prompts was easy to follow and could not be more friendlier. The main screen and navigation blends in a mixer of traditional & modern look. Home screen does offer a lot, I like that it gives me lots options to choose from. The remote control just complements it well. Nothing feels lacking. Knowing that this just the start, I know it will only get better over time.

"I bought this model on a recommendation from Consumer Reports. The panel size (thickness, bezel, etc.) is what I expected and makes the TV relatively light and easy to wall mount. The remote control is acceptable in its quality and layout, but it is very sparse in its button options considering the complexity of the TV and the attached devices. The photovoltaic charging of the remote's battery is a nice feature and works as described. The sound quality of the built-in speakers is acceptable although they are lacking in bass performance compared to most soundbars and other external speakers.

The screen performance is a problem. Motion faster than human movement speeds causes judder even in Gaming Mode. I have tried the Samsung recommended settings and various online recommendations with no improvement. Automatic and manual adjustment of the screen for older shows and movies with aspect ratios other than 16:9 very frequently results in unacceptable blurring. This would be less of a problem if the zoom/up-res feature was easier to control or disable. The screen brightness is good, and the automatic panel brightness setting works well.

The Smarthub feature is awful. Both the AppleTV and Discovery+ apps that came with the TV, and cannot be removed, don't work. The Discovery+ problem is bad enough that Samsung has its own troubleshooting guide specific to the app on smart TVs. Luckily, I still had my 4K FireTV stick so I could use those apps through an alternative route. The most infuriating thing is the barrage of advertising that is required for the Smarthub with no way to opt out or minimize the number of ads. It may be silly, but I remember when buying a product like a TV didn't come with the requirement that the manufacturer be allowed to place advertisements on screen.

"The title says the positive aspects but there is an issue I'm having and can't give this a 5 star rating until they fix it. I'm hoping it's a firmware issue that can be fixed with an over the air update.

I noticed that the edge of the picture is being cut off. I know your first thought is that it's an HDMI over scan issue or cable issue but it's not. This problem happens even when the TV is running on its own internal apps. As you can see in the 4th picture the tech support was logged in and there is a clear row and column on the right and top of the screen that were not being illuminated. This is using the integrated Samsung TV app.

In the first 3 shots you can see a test image I created which is 4096x2160 and has a 1 pixel wide red border. As can be seen in all of the pictures part of that border is being cut off. All of these pictures were taken at different times and you can see that a different part of the border is cut off at different times. The picture offset is always shifting. It shifts while using the onboard apps as well. You can see the non illuminated rows using a flashlight.

While this issue is not a problem for watching movies it is a big problem when using it with a PC as information at the corners of the screen is being cut off.

Samsung please fix this.

The downsides don't have anything to do with the panel. The menu is designed to upsell you content rather than give you what you are looking for. Switching to PC, having a dedicated PC button has to be added to the home under the settings and you can't remove the paid content icon in the apps drawer.

Also it came with 2 plastic panels that cover the cables on the back of the TV. They didn't fit very well but I did get them to stay.",B09VHBLV4Y,Easy set up. Great picture,Style: 43-inch,5.0 out of 5 stars

"You need three things:
1) A Samsung S10 Galaxy or newer phone model
2) A S95B TV
3) The Samsung SMART THINGS application downloaded to the Samsung phone

Now you can professionally calibrate the S95B movie mode. Just make sure you can completely stabilize the phone and keep it 3cm or less from the TV during the process. It looks amazing!

EDIT: One month in and the OUT-OF-THE-BOX game mode is something I still am in awe of. The colors in lush environments like the ones in Elden Ring are jaw dropping.

EDIT #2: Samsung NERFED the TV and their TV calibration phone app. They erased the professional and semi-professional settings on their calibration app and now have the simple version. They also vanished the previous calibration setting(movie) I had used the old professional version of the calibration app that now does not exist.
DO NOT DOWNLOAD ANY SAMSUNG TV SOFTWARE VERSION ON THE S95B AFTER THE 1211 UPDATE.
If you do/did, use the simple version calibration setting on the phone app with the TV and then manually go into the TV's SETTINGS-PICTURE-EXPERT SETTINGS-raise ST.2084 to +2 to get back most of the brightness that the TV lost with the 1302 or newer Samsung software updates.

"You can read about the bent screens elsewhere. Mine didn't have one, but the design of this TV tells me they were not thinking about longevity. All of the weight is at the bottom and the top 3rd is just screen and very thin. It was stressful to mount because of this. I was so worried about breaking the screen that I'll probably never move it (once Samsung fixes the issues I mean).

So these are the issues I am having. First, because of the varying ages of TVs in my house, we have Rokus in each room. We then have the same experience in all rooms. The issue we are having is random bouts of video and audio syncing. And yes, I have tried this Roku in other rooms and other Rokus on this TV. It happens only on this TV. I have also gone out of my way to buy very high quality HDMI cables with no luck. Mind you, this box worked with my other TV with the cables I already had so I'm just grasping to figure this one out. I've even reset the TV and the box to see if something was jacked during setup.

Second, the TV just wants to shut off randomly. Probably 10-15 times since purchased a month and a half ago (yes, out of the 30 day return period before noticing a pattern). And this seems to be getting worse the past week.

And finally, the OS is very slow to respond and load things. Because of the Roku issues, we have been using the apps directly on the TV and they take forever to load and to navigate once they load.

In all, this is a horrible TV that is the final nail for me buying any additional Samsung products. I would look elsewhere and not waste your time on anything Samsung, especially this TV.",B09VHBLV4Y,Value @ price. / Pro's and con's,Style: 55-inch,5.0 out of 5 stars

I don't know if this is a quality control issue with Samsung, or if the TV was mishandled during the Amazon shipping process.

"I got this tv for several reasons
- my tv of 10+ years died
- I’m retired
- I wanted a smart tV
- I deserve to splurge lol
- Price
- Size

My issue is after trouble shooting and calling customer service having several ppl transfer me going over the same steps with five different ppl and then waiting for them to get back to me because they couldn’t help and had to kick my issue up to another department
AFTER ALL OF THAT I get an email that tells me to reset everything which I’d done several times already and then they send instructions to go to my PC computer and down load something on my PC ( which I don’t own) put it on a usb drive and put it on the TV etc etc etc
Problem with that is
1. I’m an apple person
2. I’m retired from the entertainment industry and my laptop retired with me I literally gave it away
So 3. There are no computers in my house (well that’s not exactly true I have my original desktop square tan Mac from 1988 but I haven’t booted it up in over 25 years) but if there were a computer it wouldn’t be a PC

Of all the ppl I know I literally don’t know anyone who owns a PC

So that was the reason for me just giving up after exchanging this TV and having the same issues with the second one

Okay so these were the 2 issues I had on the 2 TVs I received and ended up returning back to Amazon

These issues were happening among several apps peacock 🦚 TV, Paramount TV, YouTube, HBO, Disney+, and Hulu

First and most annoying
1/4 of the screen is cut off. Why? No idea. example on peacock 🦚 tv I put on a film and it is a “Focus Feature film” on the screen I would see FOC and the next line Feat

I put on a move id seen or tv show and half of someone’s face was gone just cut off

On say HBO or on Disney I will have the whole picture BUT I have to have the sound all the way up to the maximum Volume be in complete silence or you can’t hear anything and even then keep the subtitles on God forbid someone whispers on screen you won’t be able to hear that shit LITERALLY

I’m not against doing the work. I know everything is not perfect for everyone. I understand you get want to pay for and you may have to do more work when you pay less for things.
I just think this tv is for a PC person due to its issues not being fixable with out owning a PC. In order to get the firmware you have to down load and install you need a PC believe me I tried on a friends MacBook and it can’t be done on the tv itself.

So mixed reviews for this TV
It’s not a bad tv
The picture is great when you get the whole picture the sound is great when you get normal sound but if like me you aren’t a PC person then buyer beware if the firmware ever needs to be upgraded it will require you to do so with a PC",B09WQPKTRY,had it about a week so far so good,Size: 55-inchConfiguration: TV only,5.0 out of 5 stars

"I agree with the other people that said the legs suck. They're really bad. Way too small for the TV which wants to pitch forward. It really does need to be in a wall mount and they could add 25 bucks to the price to solve a problem or they could spend more than a dollar on the legs in the first place.

This TV freezes, sticks, stutters to the point that it has to be unplugged to reboot itself. This happens across many apps and when going through HDMI. It can happen after 10 minutes or 3 hours. I have updated it.

It truly is a shame. This TV has a beautiful picture. It adjusts to the light in the room and the colors are stunning. I have a Sanyo in my living room that doesn't look this good. The stereo sound is great and it will get very loud and not break up. It's perfect for my bedroom. I really wish it worked.

I cannot rent movies from Amazon or Vudu with this television. From Amazon the message says to ""use your phone or computer to rent this movie"" which really makes me wonder about this operating system.

"Honestly an ideal pick for a dorm/studio where space is limited and you want the feeling of a TV that you can’t get with a monitor. Android TV is fairly comprehensive although the low Ram and potential manufacturing QC issues (they are manufactured in India, I know because mine was still set there regionally) can make it hard for non tech savvy users to get the most out of their experience. Works for gaming but wouldn’t recommend for anything with Latency being critical to gameplay.

"My wife sent me the listing for this TV when she received it as a special sale item and even though my current old TV was still working fine, I decided that it was a good enough deal that I would upgrade to 4K finally. I liked that it had a lot of potentially beneficial connectivity between other devices, like cameras and other smart home stuff. I already had a TV wall mount from my old TV. The only problem was the mounting holes on the back of this TV were different and I didn't have the leftovers from the mounting hardware, so I had to wait until the next morning to run to the hardware store and get what I needed. After that, it was up on the wall within minutes. Another problem: the mounting of the bracket on the back on the TV is much lower than my old one, so the TV sits about 8-10"" higher than before. I will need to take down the TV and move the entire wall bracket down so it sits at the right height.

Setup is pretty easy, getting through the general stuff, the WiFi connection, updates, and scanning through the TV channels...yes, I still use antenna for a couple local channels I can't get through streaming. That all went fine. I connected my existing in-wall HDMI cable to the ARC port and set my receiver to the Roku input. I had great picture and audio. I decided that I should also try using the TV with its built-in Fire TV capabilities.

That's where things went off the rails. The ARC was working fine for all of a few minutes, and then after changing a couple unrelated settings and rebooting the TV, I had no more sound over ARC. I messed with settings on the TV and my receiver for 10-15 minutes before turning to the internet for help. I found an answer that said to unplug the TV for a few minutes and then it should work again. Great. Did that and I did indeed have sound over the ARC channel, but it would cut out every 5-7 seconds. I tried messing with all sorts of settings but eventually gave up and just connected an optical cable between the TV and receiver to get sound working properly. I might have to try a newer HDMI cable to see if that makes any difference.

With that working, I was able to use the native Fire TV apps. I've been using the native Fire TV system now for a couple months and I have to say, it needs work. When the apps work, they work. But every once in a while, and it's happening almost daily now, I'll load an app and it won't respond. I'll have to reboot the TV and then the apps will start working most of the time. Sometimes even a reboot won't work and I just have to wait for the app to eventually load. I don't think its an internet or WiFi issue, since nothing else seems to have any problems. I just think the Fire TV environment is slow. I don't know if it's because of the hardware or the software, but the instant I started using it, I could tell how much slower it was to respond to anything compared to the Roku box I have.

Needless to say, as a display, this thing works great. The picture is clear and bright, the details are amazing. I haven't played much with the picture settings, as out-of-box, it was already good. I like that it integrates the OTA TV channels right into the menu so I don't have to change the input. I also like the on-screen notifications from Alexa for specific things that I have set up. I haven't played much with the integration of the Ring doorbell and the picture-in-picture display for it. I also plugged a web camera into the USB port on the TV and it recognized it, but I haven't tried to use Zoom yet with it.

I gave it 5 stars, despite the issues with ARC, as that may not necessarily be the fault of the manufacturer, but more an issue with my cable, or the setup between the TV and my receiver...maybe they just don't work well together. I've read that Yamaha's receivers all tend to be finicky with ARC, so it may just be that. I'm also not dropping any stars, despite the speed issues, as it could potentially be related to my network, or might work fine after an update. Either way, I could use it as just a display with my Roku and it would be a 5-star display at that point. But then I'd lose any capabilities with the integrated Alexa and smart features.",B08T6F8YBH,Order was fulfilled perfectly. Very happy. With television,Size: 65 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Not very smart. With terrible support. Even though I was an audio/videophile, when I could afford it, and even though this TV is not OLED, I am extremely pleased with the TV, picture-wise (plus I got it on sale for $299,which helps expectations). The sound is acceptable, until I can augment with external speakers. I can hear it just fine and there's enough audio settings, esp voice enhancing, to set it to hear around my apt. I have it on its stand, on a table, so there's room for the sound to reflect off the table. If you wall mount it, this will not be true, so may be6much quieter. But it's much better than I thought and the sound approximates as home theater-ish as it can (not much, granted!). The preset EQ is terrible. There's no separate bass, treble, mid settings.

I have had no trouble running the TV with and casting from my 2yr old Motorola Android phone. From every streaming service app. Set up was easy, after I got the hang of a smart TV, and I easily downloaded the TV and phone apps and logged into all my streaming accounts.

I was bothered that there weren't many video settings but as of yesterday's significant software update, there's more. But if you don't want to be bothered, it's certainly acceptable set as delivered, or using the many video presets.

The bad: I can't mirror from my desktop computer to the TV. My research shows that only Intel Pentium 4th generation processors will reliably connect. I have a 3rd generation (Sandy Bridge) processor, and even though it did connect, with some issues, for about 3min, it hasn't since. While Mirrorcast, included with Windows running on a Sandy Bridge processor, may successfully mirror to your TV, it *very* well may not. This is all Wi-Fi. I have yet to try using an HDMI cable and using the TV as a 2nd monitor. Or buying a Chromecast device, which is even more money. But gamers be cautious (I am not a gamer, per se, but I would love to run my Second Life virtual world on a 50"" screen!). I have to send movies I own or home video clips, etc, to YouTube, in order to watch on the TV. This takes forever, esp if HD or UHD. Like 12+hrs to process if UHD. I need to update my DVD player but why should I have to. Why wasn't the info about the processors front and center on the sales info? I only think it's recently on the TV support page. Not sure about AMD machines and don't remember what it said about Mac, but I don't think it was good. Check it on Amazon mirroring page for this TV.

Even though I went crazy searching the internet for a cure for mirroring, most info is for a Firestck and not FireTV. Similar but not the same. The Amazon support pages are a brief joke.

I finally, before giving up mirroring, called support yesterday. I've worked support (granted, developer support) and I was shocked. I knew way more than she did, and she was obviously using the internet or a database, for the simplest of questions, which I can do! Her TV simulator had a whole different menu than the TV! And it took me 5min to convince her (how hard is ""My menu doesn't have that."" to understand?). I was hoping to escalate the call to a more technical tier, but, after a ridiculous conversation all I could get was a supervisor. The supervisor was much *more* knowledgeable, but still not the TECHNICAL support I was after. I don't want to be told, ""The software won't connect on your machine."" Which software? Why won't it work? How do you know my computer and what's on it? Plus it was a HARDWARE issue. I actually found the processor info while on hold while they Googled their answers. So I guess the call wasn't a waste... TBF, these ladies were *incredibly* patient and nice. Even called me back when the call got dropped. If you have a simple issue, they would be ok, if you can get past the things I've mentioned. English was most excellent.

I'll spare you my rant about a big company like Amazon should be able to field at least minimal support. Esp for expensive and smart products. I will never buy an big tech Amazon brand again.

Even though I am happy with the TV, only as a TV, I dinged 2 stars for terrible support, the hidden mirroring info, and the difficult software and user interface. As a former software developer, it's like it was written by 12yr old interns. It's really important that you are able to control and cast the TV from your phone, for the best experience.

There's also no way to display the time/date on the screen, without rooting the TV and running software! Even my 80s TVs and VCRs could do that, with one on/off setting, and reliably set sleep time! Setting sleep time, screensaver options, and such is broken, although I did notice that the quick sleep timer is working better since the update. Settings are very confusing. Nothing seems like it's where it should be, esp on the big gear menu from the Home screen. The remote settings overlay (from remote) is slightly better but menus arranged differently. Oh, and the teenie, tiny remote really stinks, but I have a remote control phone app which helps, although not worth it just to do volume and other simple things. Again, if not for my phone, this TV would be far less enjoyable.

As of this review, I've owned the TV for a month, with heavy use, with no malfunctions. Knock wood, and I hope it lasts as long as the 24 payments. I am a senior lady with health issues, but was able to unpack, screw on the stand, and set it up myself. It was very hard on me, but there was no one else here to do it. I was using it within 20min. Very A/V tech literate, though.

I've been watching it with glee, coming from years of having to use my 24"" 1080p computer monitor. If I had owned big modern TVs before, this might be a 1star review. It's far lower in overall quality, in every way, (granted, much cheaper) than my 90s Sony big screen TV, even with its limited resolution. Lighter and smaller, though, even though same size.

"I have a significant investment in Amazon Fire TV Cubes (3) and Sticks (6) and so I decided to try out the Amazon Fire TV (43 Inch Omni). This is for my master bedroom and is not my main viewing TV. I also own an LG 55 inch C6 (OLED), a 65 inch LG 9000 (IPS panel) and a 55 inch Hisense U8G (VA panel) which are fairly high end TV’s that all have above average picture quality and upscale functionality.

The Omni TV does not compare to my main TV’s in picture quality, however, the 4K picture is actually quite decent for a bedroom TV whose main viewing time is either early morning or late evening (in a darkened room). Also, we don’t have any soundbars, DVD players, or Cable boxes attached to the Omni TV. We use YouTube TV for local channels and have a number of streaming services (Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, etc.).

What I like about the Omni TV
1. Very lightweight at 15.5 pounds making it easy to mount on the wall.
2. Set up was extremely easy since I am a registered Amazon customer. Plug it in, answer a few questions the TV does a software update, linked to my saved settings for WiFi, automatically downloaded my previous applications from my Fire TV Stick and it was ready to go.
3. The interface is exactly like all my other Fire TV Sticks and Cubes, there was no learning curve. The interface is zippy and functions well. After loading 30+ applications I still had 6 GB of memory unused, which is great. I was also able to jailbreak the TV (like the Fire TV Stick) and download Kodi, Cinema HD, Downloader, IP Vanish, and several other 3rd party utilities, with no problem. All applications work great.
4. Based on the integrated voice and Fire TV capability, you don’t need to spend $50 on a FireTV Max or $100 on a Fire TV Cube and a $30 Echo Dot, making the TV an even greater value.
5. The Bluetooth remote is a nice design and easy to use. A bit of an enhancement over the base Fire TV stick remote with some controls unique to the Omni TV (like settings, channel selector, prior key, live TV key)
6. The integrated voice commands worked for the most part. Actually, this is pretty cool and should only get better over time. I do have one issue where Voice Commands such as “Turn on the TV” work just fine, but “Turn Off the TV” does not work. This is a minor issue and hopefully will get fixed with future software updates. Note: Amazon customer service could not find a resolution to this problem other than resetting my TV and wiping out all my downloaded applications/passwords. I elected to live with the problem. All other commands seem to work well.
7. The 4K picture quality is acceptable in the bedroom.
8. The price is excellent. At $300 for the 43-inch TV, it was priced appropriately for the functionality.
9. Once you get used to how to tweak the picture using the Picture Mode function (Standard, Movie, Dynamic, Custom) settings you can improve the quality of the picture a bit. For me, the Movie mode, with Picture Temp set to Warm 1 worked best for me. Compared to other TV’s the number of adjustments are very limited. However, for ease of use for most users, this is probably acceptable. I do like using voice commands to “Switch Picture Mode to Standard, Movie, Dynamic, etc.”. This saves clicking the remote button multiple times and is easier to execute.
10. Integration to my Ring Doorbell and 4 cameras around my property works great. The Omni TV supports either full screen as well as Picture in Picture and is voice-activated. “Show me the Front Yard Camera” is all that is needed to bring up the picture….very easy to do.
11. All my TP-Link KASA smart plugs can be activated via voice through the Omni TV, i.e. “Turn on the bedroom lights”., “Turn off my backyard landscape lights”, etc.
12. Drop-in works across other Echo Dots.
13. The Omni TV can participate in standard “Speaker Groups”. i.e. “Play music Upstairs” works.
14. You can control attached Sound Bars, DVD players, and Cable boxes with this TV (like the Fire TV Cube). With 4HDMI ports, you have a lot of expansion capabilities. It comes with an IR blaster that can be used for non-bluetooth devices.
15. You can attach up to two Echo Dots to this TV to improve the sound quality. In my opinion, the sound quality on this set is ok for a bedroom. Not great, but not bad either. After all, it is a bedroom!!
16. The 43 inch size is perfect for a bedroom TV. Bumping up to a 50 or 55 inch TV would have been too big for my space. Not all TV manufacturers offer this size.

What I don’t like about the Fire TV
1. The lack of Dolby Vision and HDR 10+ limits the 4K picture quality. Dolby Vision should have been included in all the TV’s and not just the 65 and 75 inch models.
2. The backlighting is very basic with direct-lit. I would have paid more to get Full Array backlighting to enhance picture quality.
3. Good HDR requires much higher NITs - I.e. brightness (like 500 to 600) to be truly effective. The Omni TV seems to top out around 325, which is not enough to make HDR details pop in a dark scene.
4. The VA Panel has poor side viewing angles (most all vendors have this problem) but in my bedroom, this was not a problem.

All in all, I would recommend this TV if you want a decent 4K picture for a bedroom, want to save some bucks, and are invested in the Amazon echo system. The price is great for what you get and you don’t need to purchase a Fire TV and Echo Dot to gain voice control with another TV brand.

For the main viewing area, I would pay more for a larger higher quality TV that supports Dolby Vision, Full Array backlighting, better-upscaling processor, and higher HDR peak brightness.

UPDATE 5/2/22 FIX for TV not shutting down by voice command
I was able to solve the voice problem of why the Omni TV's Alexa would ""Turn on the TV"" but fail to ""Turn off the TV"" (it would always go back to the home screen and never shut down). The solution was to go into the Alexa App on my Phone - Select Devices, then - Select All Devices - Find my Omni TV in the device list - Select the Omni TV then TURN OFF Two items 1) Adaptive Listening and 2) Follow up Mode. The minute I made these two changes the TV will now turn off using my voice. Many of my Echo Dots have these features turned on so I made the assumption that the Omni TV would work the same way since these features are available. That was a wrong assumption. My guess is when you have the Follow Up mode turned on, during the shut down process, Alexa gets confused and is waiting for a follow up command (so it does not shut down). In my opinion this is a software bug. I am surprised that Amazon support does not have this easy fix in their knowledge base. If you have this problem, try my fix.",B08T6F8YBH,"GREAT picture, but the UI is too much.",Size: 55 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I have very mixed opinions about the Omni 43"", which I've only had for a few days now. I mainly chose this television for 2 reasons: 1) I wanted a smart TV, so I could watch OTA channels without switching inputs. And 2), I'm already invested in the Amazon ecosystem, so why wouldn't I go with a FireTV? That it's even an Amazon product has to be a plus, right?

Err, maybe. The Amazon payment option also figured into my decision. The TV arrived quickly in 3 days, although the Amazon delivery driver failed to read the warning on the box about not setting it on it's side. The setup was quick and easy, thanks to it already being registered to my Amazon account and downloading the apps I'd been using on my Fire Stick.

The picture quality leaves some to be desired, though. I'm neither an audiophile or videophile, but despite my attempts to tune the picture settings, it always looks a little cloudy and fuzzy. That's not to say that it's terrible, but it replaced one that's 10+ years older, and that cost nearly half the price, and yet I think the old one looks better. In fact, the 4K capability is about the only advantage the Omni has over my old television.

Speaking of which, the Omni version of Alexa allegedly does all these things that are not capable with a FireStick and a dumb TV. Off the top of my head, tuning the TV on/off with Alexa is one example. But I'd been doing that with a FireStick and dumb TV for several years. I can't explain it, but all these ""advantages"" already seemed available to me, with the exception of one or possibly two.

My echo dot had trouble hearing me when my dumb TV was on, so I had to yell to have it change channels or turn off the TV. This isn't a problem with the Omni and that's one of the best things about it. I've yet to use a camera with the Omni, but when I kid you not, when I asked it to display my Ring Doorbell, it said that ""cameras were not supported on this device"" or something akin to that. It later began working fine with my cameras, so I guess it just took a while to get things straight. Btw, my old dumb TV actually had a few advantages over the Omni, as well, adding to my mixed feelings here.

Finally, I want to talk about the included ""Fire Cube"", advanced Alexa implementation or whatever they call it. I was hoping to use it as a regular Echo device and move the Echo I already had into another room. The Alexa implementation was also mixed, though. It works quite well and does offer advantages over an Echo Dot, like how I previously mentioned it hearing me better with the TV turned on. But it's incomplete and more like the Alexa implementation in the FireStick remote, except that you don't have to push a button to speak to it.

For example, you can't put it in a group in the Alexa app and you can't use it in some routines. I'm still discovering the differences, but it doesn't appear that the Alexa in Omni is a viable replacement for an Echo device, which is a real shame. Furthermore, Alexa uses the same volume control as the TV, but one is always much louder. For example, if you're watching TV and ask Alexa something, you might not be able to hear her response. But if you turn up the volume to hear her, then the TV will blast your ears off. And this is just with the built-in TV speakers and normalization turned on to level the volume. There needs to be separate volumes or some sort of control for this, imo.

That's all I have for now, but I'll update this if I have anything else to add. Overall, I don't think the Omni is terrible, but it needs some work and just feels unfinished. Considering how Amazon uses Zoom to sell it, they should have included a $15 camera for free, considering the already high price for what you get.

Oh yeah, one more thing. I can't figure out any way to customize closed captioning for OTA channels. Caption customization works fine for everything else, so it's only the OTA channels. This isn't a problem for my other Smart TV, so I assume it's not a problem with OTA signals. And it's not a huge deal, but it's another example of something unfinished on the set.

I will end on a positive note, however. The reviews all say that the sound isn't very good. I happen to think it's decent for a TV in this price range. Some say that a sound bar is a requirement with this set, but I disagree. The sound is actually better than my other Smart TV and I love that it's has options for those who are hard of hearing (i.e. dialogue clarity). Ironically, one of the biggest disappointments for reviewers, has been one of the few things that I'm actually pleased with here. It's also super easy to just tell Alexa where you want the sound level.

Update: The Alexa implementation continues to impress me and I'm willing to admit that it's better than I originally thought. But it's still not a full replacement for an Echo device and it has a ways to go to get there. Right now you just can't use it in a smart home to do the things that an Echo device will do.

I've already had multiple updates and they've actually fixed some problems, but not others. And I'm still finding more, as well. This could be a great smart TV some day, but it was just released too soon and it feels too much like a beta version. Having said that, it still feels a need for me, so I'll be keeping it, while hoping to see improvements that shouldn't even be needed in a new TV. Amazon really needs to concentrate on getting hardware working right in the future.

Update II: Another disappointment: The menu navigation is surprisingly slow for a new TV. My Fire TV Stick 4K was much faster, despite being 2 years old and having little storage space left. Not to mention that it has half the memory of the Omni TV.

Update III: I have to give Amazon credit for regular updates. Most are probably for apps and the guide, but some have fixed existing problems already.

One glaring problem is the inability to choose a default profile for logging into the system, without removing profiles altogether. I have my mother on my account, so I can set everything up for her and because I want to be able to login to my profile from her TV. However, this means you need to choose a profile before Alexa will fulfill a Ring camera request, which defeats the purpose of Alexa making things easier. Surely this wouldn't be difficult to fix and it needs a fix real bad. Besides, who wants to choose a profile whenever it's unnecessary?

Update III: Seems that a recent update has made it possible to have your Ring camera alerts automatically display a live view on the Omni TV. This is why I chose this TV and I consider it a huge feature, since I don't live in the safest neighborhood. It doesn't seem to work with the original Ring Doorbell, however.

Unfortunately, recent updates have also made the sound worse. I often have to turn the volume way up to hear it now and the volume slider moves very slow.

Speaking of which, I've come to the conclusion that the biggest problem with this TV is that it sorely lacks the hardware sources it needs to function properly. The result is that menu navigation is slow and it often crashes. You'd think the opposite would be true for a television attempting to be more advanced, but nope.",B08T6F8YBH,Just a upgrade,Size: 42 inchStyle: TV Only,4.0 out of 5 stars
"The first one arrived with a shattered screen (see the photo on this review) and the new one arrived w/o issue. I'll speak about the return issues later in this post, but as they do not affect the quality of this TV I will leave that for later.

The TV is heavier than I would have expected, and the first one that had the shattered screen felt very cheaply made. From the feel of the new one, the screen glass is part of the structural integrity of the entire TV, which seems like it would put too much stress on the glass to me, through the glass does appear to be laminated safety glass which does give it more strength, but it is still glass (I'm basing that on the pattern of the cracks from the first TV as some of them did not ""show"" on the surface and appeared to actually be ""under"" the top layer of glass).

The picture quality is really good and I have not noticed any weakness in the blacks as I read in other web sites reviews (at least not after I adjusted the colors, contrast and brightness). I have also used it for gaming and have not noticed any issues with the ""only"" 60Hz refresh rate (I mean TV's I grew up with were less than half that and I'm not sure the naked human eye can tell the difference between 60 and 120Hz).

The sound is really weak in the bass range, but the optical output works mostly (it does not work with Netflix for some reason) with my ILive sound bar (which the remote is able to control) to add bass back in it sounds ok. I didn't try other sound profiles, so maybe there are better ones.

Alexa integration work well (this my first Alexa product so I have nothing else to compare it too) except that it doesn't seem to know my TV has a sleep timer (it tells me it is not supported even though it's right there in the menu). Not sure if that is a software or hardware issue.

I agree with most of the 3rd party reviews I read, for the price you will be hard pressed to find a better price point, but it is more like an ""entry level"" piece of hardware for someone like me that this is my 1st 4K TV, and some video aficionados may find the feature set lacking, but so far everything I have used more than meets the needs of most people that just want a good TV for a good price.

-------------------------------Returns issues below not reflected in review above------------------
Now for the issues returning the broken one. Amazon only gave me 2 options, pay for it myself or have UPS pick it up. Well I was not willing to pay the return shipping as that would probably be as much or more than I paid for the TV. UPS pickup is problematic because I have a job and can't be around all day waiting for them to show up. I tried to call UPS and schedule or at least get an idea of when they would be there, but because I didn't have the tracking number they would could not help me. I ended up having to take a day off work so I could sit home on day 3 to make sure the TV was sent back.

Then Amazon didn't think I returned the item, so I ended up getting charged again for the TV. I went back and forth with Amazon on this multiple times and in the end, I ""guess"" they refunded my money, but what they did was refund the $205 is gift cards I used, credited my credit card for the price I paid for the TV and then charged me full price for the TV (which was only $10 more than the sale price when I bought it but still), so I ended up paying full price for a TV that was on sale and I was not able to use $205 in gift cards to help pay for it. I would not have paid full price for this TV and yet that is what I ended up having to do. I won't purchase any more ""big ticket"" items from Amazon, and will be limiting my purchases here in the future. It seems Amazon has decided to no longer care about the customer anymore. Time to find a better vendor to give my business to.",B08T6F8YBH,PERFECT entry level gaming TV,Size: 55 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"For the price the picture is amazing, I was stunned watching in HDR, fantastic.

The problem is the horrible software. There is a big lag when using the controls especially when making changes to the picture. Calling up the picture controls can mean waiting 15-30 seconds. You start to wonder if you pressed the button. Finally the controls appear and you try moving through them. There can be a lag there too, waiting to move down the list.

Want to change the brightness or any setting with a number value that goes to 100? You need to hope you are lucky and the tv isn't laggy again because holding down a button to decrease or increase a value can mean hearing 30 clicks on screen and seeing a value change by one number. To get it unstuck click down or up one at a time, it seems to unfreeze it, then you can go quickly again.

The bad lag problem is intermittent. Turn the tv on and everything works great, then it doesn't and you have to wait forever for it to make changes.

Alexa fails. She's working great, doing whatever you need. Then you ask her to do something and the tv flat out won't respond. Unplug the tv, plug it in and start again. I have had to do the three to four times a week. Happens so often I am using a smart plug so I do not have to go over to the set.

For the price the picture quality is a steal in my opinion. The tv is light and was easy to install and I am glad it can work with Alexa. the only reason I can accept the horrible software (I didn't mention all the problems) is because I bought the tv when it was on sale and the price was very low.

My next tv I want to be OLED and I am not planning on buying Amazon brand again. By the way, this is my second Amazon brand television and I had zero problems with the first one.",B08T6F8YBH,Great TV,Size: 42 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I've had the TV a month now, so my review comes with many hours of usage & frustration.

(This review was updated 08/28/2022 and is at the end of this one)

I bought the 55"" Omni during Prime Day because it was a great deal on Amazon's new line of TV's...but have been very disappointed with the picture quality and lack of Alexa integration with Cox Cable's Contour box.

As others have reported, the picture quality has a hazy/halo-like appearance, instead of having a crisp & sharp quality and colors. Darkened scenes, such as night or not well lit scenes are so dark, that you can't see many things, details, or faces in the picture. I've spent umpteen hours resetting, adjusting, and fidgeting with the color & image controls with little improvement. It's simply a terrible quality screen & image.

I have a 12 year old LG 47"" flatscreen TV that still has a beautiful image & color quality, much better than this Omni. I bought the Omni to replace it, but have been very disappointed and annoyed by the image & color quality.

As for the Alexa voice integration and Alexa TV remote, they work great & are very convenient for Prime Video...but they don't work at all with Cox Cable's Contour cable box, which is upsetting for a brand new TV. The odd thing is that the TV and remote identify & recognize Cox Cable and the Contour box as a device hooked to it...but Alexa won't obey voice commands, such as, 'Change to channel 52'. And the Alexa remote buttons won't control channel changing, either, although I've paired the remote to the Contour box following the on-screen prompts, as well as re-doing the steps manually, according to Amazon's instructions and support website. The only thing that works is the Mute button. I've asked Amazon support about this and they have no answers, not even wanting to admit that Alexa & Contour devices won't talk to each other.

Basically, the TV recognizes the Contour box, but won't control it. I have a feeling that Amazon deliberately doesn't want to integrate with Contour for their own reasons, but won't admit it, and falsely represents Alexa's compatibility and then wastes customers' time trying to pretend that they don't know about this when customers try to get support to resolve it. All they do is point you back to the same support website for pairing devices to the TV that you've already tried...then blame Cox when they can't get rid of you, because you're mad at spending all this money on a TV where Alexa only half-works. Cox's Contour box has been around for awhile and there's no excuse for this lack of functionality.

In the end, I'm not happy or satisfied with this TV or Amazon and would not recommend it, unless you want something cheap to use in a guest room. I'm keeping the TV because I don't want to spend more money on another brand right now, but I won't be buying Amazon's Omni TV in the future, as I replace two other TV's in the home that are getting older.

REVIEW UPDATED 08/28/2022
To Amazon's credit, their customer service dept. called & emailed me after reading this review and worked with me to understand the issues, but had no resolutions, so they offered to replace the TV under warranty. I agreed, but opted to pay the difference and upgrade to the 65"" Omni Fire TV, which I ordered.

If you can spare the extra dollars, I strongly recommend purchasing the 65"" Omni. It is very superior to the 55"" Omni in terms of build & picture quality. Out of the box, the picture was phenomenal. The TV also has a thin, yet strong silver steel frame surrounding the edges of the TV, which make it very rigid & strong. Smaller Fire TV's don't have this steel frame, so they flex when lifting or moving them.

The 65"" Omni is a huge & heavy TV that requires a lot of room and likely two people to lift & place it, if you're a mere mortal and normal-sized human. I'm neither, so I was able to heft the TV by myself, from the ground to its new home on a stand several feet off the ground.

As for the Alexa vs Cox Contour cable box issue, that magically resolved itself one night on the 65"" TV, either due to an update or some fiddling I did in the Fire TV's settings...I don't know what the magic bullet was, but Alexa can now communicate with Contour and change cable channels by voice command.

On that note, I really enjoy using Alexa to voice-control the cable TV, Prime, volume, mute, etc. It's so much more convenient than using remotes. But Amazon has to be careful about this technology, it's future iterations, and how it's used in the home, because it treads a fine line between convenience and invasion of privacy. If I ever feel their devices go too far and violate my privacy, or that I can't trust Amazon, I'll never use or buy their TV's or devices again.

In the end, I'm very happy with this 65"" Omni and glad I upgraded from the 55"" Omni. I'm also very happy with Amazon's quick response to contact me about replacing the 55"" TV and not screwing around. If I could review their customer service separately, I would. But all I could do was call & email them to thank them for their good service to make me happy.

Although I would like to change my original 2-star review to a 5-star review, because of Amazon's outstanding customer service and how great the 65"" Fire TV is, I decided to leave it 2-stars, since the original review was for the 55"" TV, not the 65"". Amazon's system won't allow me to do a separate review of the 65"" TV I purchased...it keeps throwing me back to this review to update...so I'm stuck simply adding the updated info here.

Hope this helps people who are on the fence about Fire TV's and which size to get.",B08T6F8YBH,Great tv for the price,Size: 65 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Pros:

Great big TV with 4 HDMI inputs - one dedicated for ARC for soundbars or speaker setups

Easy setup and customization

Fast connection speeds - i thought i had my ethernet cord in correctly but realized after three apps installed i saw that i didn’t plug it in. it was so fast with its wireless connection i didn’t realize it wasn’t wired.

Cons:

Remote pairing for cable boxes is a half days worth of searching for codes & ending up using auto search mashing a button for 20 minutes per input.

On the Fence:

Alexa - if you are all in on voice control this is the tv for you, i don’t use it personally so it’s nice that there is a physical switch on the bottom of the tv to turn that off - then you can run through the various alexa menus to turn that off or any privacy or ad serving settings - took me a half hour to undo all that, not sure the average person has the patience for that but hey maybe you can do it faster than me. This isn’t a con than more than a personal preference.

Tips:

Use the latest 4K HDMI cables you have, anything from the early 2.0 days will cause a fit in the HDMI ARC connection.

Get a stand, feet or wall mount this tv. The supplied feet are fine and work just okay but are a little low and makes remote use a bit hard if you have a sound bar.

Audio: For anyone else with an optimum cable tv box - for audio control make sure you go into the deeper audio settings of the audio settings and have it set to “other” for output control and not dolby digital - and then volume control set to variable. so wasn’t able to control volume of the tv with my cable tv remote until i put it on these settings. It took me two days to
figure this out myself - i’m putting this here to help anyone else out.",B08T6F8YBH,"Great Picture, cable antenna connection needs work",Size: 55 inchStyle: TV Only,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I was able to get this on prime day lighting deal. The price was unbeatable to any 55inch 4k tv in the world. If I review this product based on the price I got this for it's going to be 5 stars for sure.

Considering the regular price my two cents as below,

I wouldn't buy this as my main TV for these reasons,

1. The VA panel - As expected this TV has disappointing viewing angles. The seating arrangement should right infant of the TV to get the best out of this TV.
2. Pre calibration - out of the box white balance is way off. This can be corrected but need some extra effort to get this done.
3. Dolby vision is not included in the 55 inch which effects the 4k resolution.
4. Comparing the larger versions of the same TV - The 55 inch has less premium black plastic finish

Why I absolutely buy this as a second TV to bedroom or guest room.

1. Light weight and it was just so easy to mount on the wall.
2. Excellent contrast ratio, resulting in deep blacks in a dark room.
3. Decent reflection handling. The semi-gloss finish reduces the intensity of direct reflections.
4. 4k content is displayed perfectly, with no sub-pixel dithering.
5. Very little stutter when watching movies
6. Fantastic low input lag - Specially in the Game picture mode.
7. As an existing fire TV user it was super easy to set up the TV. All settings from my fire stick can be exported with no issues.

Over all there are similar quality TVs in the market for the same price range, but with this TV consumers get a hands free experience specially if you are in amazon eco system with an unbeatable smart features with fire TV capabilities.",B08T6F8YBH,Nice tv,Size: 42 inchStyle: TV Only,1.0 out of 5 stars
"We ordered this 75"" TV and are very pleased with our purchase. There were some reviews saying the TV is slow but we have not had that experience.
Our favorite thing about this TV is that you can tell the TV to change from hdmi 1 to antenna. Once on the antenna, you can then tell the TV to change from channel 2 to 8. It even comes with Pluto TV channels built in. I don't even have to go to the app they are included in the digital channels on the antenna.
The picture is so clear and glare is nit an issue for us anymore unlike our previous TV which seemed to have more glare on the screen.
We did do a direct ethernet connection to our modem so I cannot speak to how fast this TV is on wifi but if you can. I recommend using the ethernet port built into TV because our TV is very fast and responsive. I do not normally take the time to write a review but I just had to tell other people considering buying a smart TV our experience so you can feel better about buying this TV over some of the other smart tvs out there.
One other thing to keep in mind is if you are a prime member you get access to prime TV so between prime video, Pluto and our subscription to discovery plus app we were able to completely cut out cable or satellite and now exclusively stream our entertainment which saves us over $100 a month. So if you have any interest in streaming TV and movies on demand this is a great TV to consider.",B08T6F8YBH,HDMI Port dont work properly,Size: 65 inchStyle: TV Only,1.0 out of 5 stars
"This unit replace a 55"" LG that was constantly having problems with Wi-Fi connectivity. This Fire TV redressed that as the Wi-Fi reception is great with no buffering issues whatsoever. While I can't speak to the picture quality being I'm blind, my wife said it's a step up from the LG in terms of resolution and clarity. What I really like about this TV is the Voice View screen reader capability, which enables me to access and select menu options. The speech synthesizer is decent but pronounces ""resume"" as ""revoo,"" which threw me off a bit. I still applaud Amazon for including the capability and at least considering the needs of people with disabilities, which other manufacturers don't seem to do. The hands-free control is great and I like that I'm able to use voice commands with the remote, which again has far reaching benefits for folks with disabilities who may have neuropathy and/or carpel tunnel of the fingers and hands. Alexa integration is flawless, which I'd expect from Amazon being they manufactured the TV and created both the Fire and Alexa platforms. So why not five stars, you ask?

There's no need to have to enter a pin every time you want to change a basic system setting for the TV when all you want to do is set a pin for Prime Video purchases. We have two young children, and little hands have been known to grab the remote and accidentally purchase a video or two. But if you want to set a Prime Video pin to prevent said purchases, the pin also needs to be entered for such things as changing screen resolution, changing accessibility features, and other tasks that don't have anything to do with blocking purchases. Seems this is an opportunity for Amazon to enhance user experience so the pin can be more localized to the specific task as opposed to it being a global pin to complete all tasks.

All in all, it's a fine product and it's only going to get better as the technology continues to evolve. The twenty-four month no-intrest installment plan is also great as many more folks like me with competing expenses and limited budgets will be more inclined to go with a Fire TV instead of having to shell out several hundred to more than a thousand bucks at one shot. I wish there were an option to give half stars as I give this device four and a half stars. Amazon's world domination will continue because they seem to really know what customers want while centralizing and streamlining all their content.

"When I saw this 55"" TV on Prime Day sale for $299, hands-free with Alexa, and with no-interest payments over 24 months, I just jumped on it. I've spent almost that much over time replacing lost remotes! I didn't realize how big this TV is, so I almost cancelled the order...but I'm glad I didn't. I've got it sitting on one of those sturdier metal and plastic folding tables (like a card table but rectangular), and I've plugged my Mac Mini into one of the HDMI ports so I can also use it as a computer monitor. What a difference! I can have all kinds of things I need at any given time open and placed around on the screen (see photo), and because I work in my recliner that's a good distance from the TV, I can read everything very well and get to all my open windows super-fast. Then, at night, when I'm ready to watch TV, I can sit back on the daybed that's on the opposite wall and watch it all on the big screen.

My 2014 LG soundbar works with it, but it's only got the optical port cable and cannot be controlled with Alexa. One of the Fire TV tech guys very patiently told me what I need to get if I want to upgrade my sound setup, and I went on and ordered one of the Echo Dots on sale for 19.99 because I couldn't find the one I bought before. I'll probably get a new soundbar at some point but, for now, I can certainly watch TV and listen to music using the one I have. But right now, I have to have the remote to control things that Alexa cannot control, and I keep it in a remote wrangler tied to my daybed (where I also sleep). I thought at first that the TV was just turning itself on by itself in the middle of the night, but then I realized that either I or one of my dogs was flopping over onto the remote, turning it on. That's a temporary issue because once I have an Alexa-compatible sound system set up for it, I can hang the remote on the wall and forget about it.

I've read a number of reviews of the Fire Omni TV series, and they are shown to be on the lower end, picture-wise. If I had wanted a super-duper knock-your-socks-off viewing experience for MSNBC, which is what I watch more than anything else on the TV, I would have to have spent five times as much, and why would anyone do that? Well, if you're really into the primo video experience and have the bucks, I guess you might...but this TV is perfect for me. The #1 selling point for me, other than the rock-bottom sale price, is the fact that I can control pretty much everything with my voice.

I did knock off a star for one reason and one reason only: In the Inputs setup, you can specify what type of product you have on a particular HDMI port. Soundbar, gaming console, etc., but there is no selection for ""Computer."" I want to be able to say ""Alexa, open my computer."" Now I have to say ""Alexa, open H D M I 1."" Cumbersome.

"I wouldn't have bought this at full price after reading the reviews, but I got a good prime day sale so I went for it. The quality of the image is good, with a few pretty important downsides. The contrast and darker parts of the image are pretty good, however, I feel like it could be a bit clearer without having to crank up the sharpness. After some tweaks that I found online, the picture quality is optimal. HOWEVER, a major issue of this TV is the response time --it's pretty awful. For a 4k smart tv branded under Amazon, I would expect something better. Compared to the old smart tv that I've had for several years, the response time is pretty bad. You press a button on the remote and it takes several seconds for it to respond. The image options are a bit convoluted but I got the hang of it pretty quick. A bonus for me was the Alexa integration. It's pretty cool to walk into your room and say ""Alexa, TV on"" and it powers on. At its current price point of ~$520, I'd probably hold off on this and look for something else, maybe a better well-known brand on sale. As I said before, I got this for an amazing price during the prime day, and for what I paid, its worth it, but when its not on sale, skip it.",B08T6F8YBH,What an upgrade….,Size: 55 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
it is easy to set up especially if you already had a fire stick . can download remote app on phone which is nice because the remote will get lost . Best feature for me is the HDMI out port (hdmi4) it turns on and controls my bose surround sound vs the old tv i had to use separate bose remote for that with the optical cable . picture is clear and i did not have to adjust any settings to make it look how i wanted which is nice because if i think something is off it will bug me enough that i will try to fix it and end up messing it up worse . There are better TVs but they cost considerably more . This in my opinion is the best tv in this price range by a long shot . Quality appears to be comparable to High end TVs . i’m happy but it’s only been a week . if this hasn’t been updated in a while i’m still happy.,B08T6F8YBH,Good purchase but a little disappointed,Size: 65 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"There is nothing to dislike about this television; great picture and I haven't needed to hook up the soundbar. Downloading apps is easy and I can turn the t.v. on or off, or change the channel from any room using Alexa. I can even have the t.v. turn on or off other Alexa-enabled devices, just by talking.
Another good feature is you can see the screen even from a pretty extreme angle.
This TV has so many features that I can't begin to enumerate (mainly because I haven't used them yet), but one feature that I don't think was mentioned is the description; included in the package is an infrared cable that enables the tv to transmit to gaming console through glass, so you don't have to leave doors open if your console is behind glass doors. I don't game; but I thought this was a thoughtful touch.",B08T6F8YBH,More than meeting our needs,Size: 42 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"25.July.2022 : I've had the TV actually plugged in and in-use for about a week. I use it mostly as a monitor for my spare PC or when my kid is using the bigger screen. I'll try to review per feature/function I've actually used :

Alexa : the Alexa integration is REALLY good. I have a mix of Google Home and Alexa throughout my house and I mostly lean Google because historically it responds better... The Alexa technology on this TV is actually responding so well that I've moved a couple of devices over to it (if you have LG Thinq products, this TV interacts REALLY well with those). It's very quick to respond and never misunderstands me. Definitely a major step up from other Alexa technology I've used.

FIRE TV: it's what you'd expect from Amazon (sadly) - all your apps and such like any other smart TV with a LOT of product and service pushing that you can't disable. I don't want to be advertised to on a TV I already paid for. Save the ads for your website. There is more space dedicated to advertising services you don't have than there is to apps you downloaded. All-in-all, even tho they limit the shortcut space for your downloaded apps to one short row (and use the other 20+ rows to advertise to you), the apps do actually run smoothly and I haven't had any errors or issues yet.

Picture/sound : the long and short of it is that the picture quality and sound are FANTASTIC. Even my PC games look great on this TV and that's saying something.

User Interface/hardware? : here's my one gripe... I have my PC set to HDMI 4. When the TV or the PC go into sleep mode, the TV seems to ""forget"" that the HDMI is connected. I'll turn the screen on and I'll wake the PC and it'll say ""HDMI 4"" but the screen will be blank (as opposed to ""no signal""). Just blank. I have to tell Alexa to switch to HDMI 1 and then issue a command to switch BACK to HDMI 4 and the picture will appear. I don't know why this happens and I've tried different sleep settings on either device, but the only way to avoid it is to keep both devices turned on all the time and that's just begging to burn them both out early. So, as it is currently, you have to navigate away from whatever input you're wanting to use and then back to it for it to work as intended. Maybe my TV is just glitchy or broken, I don't know, but that's been my experience.

"This FireTv Omni series replaced a 12-year-old Sony Bravia 40inch TV which was top of the line at the time. So all my comparisons are based on that swap.

First, the things which were noticeably better.
- Going from an HD TV to a 4K TV made a huge difference. The picture is clear. The colors are bright. Way more dynamic contrast.
- The thing weighs almost nothing compared to my old Bravia which had a full metal bezel around the whole frame. It was like lifting up a sheet of glass to hang the Omni.
- The smart TV features are nice to be integrated into the TV rather than having to use a separate Firestick.
- The WiFi is way faster. But I suppose the fact that no one uses a 12-year-old modem anymore should be an indicator of how antiquated that tech was in the old Sony.

Second, the things which are pretty much the same.
- The LED baklight is not really any different. Light and dark spots are noticeable. Nothing is pure black since it's just an LED backlit display.
- The sound routes through my sound system just fine and sounds pretty much the same. Basses and trebles are about what they were before the swap.
- Has pretty much the same number of ports for input/output. (Minus antique RCA ports which no one uses anymore.)

Third, the things which are worse than my old Bravia.
- The motion quality of this TV is not as good. It pixelates and has artifacts when fast objects move across slow objects. Shows me that the Bravia processing is superior. But for the price, this isn't terrible. But it is definitely noticeable and sometimes annoying.
- The control interface is not as flexible as my old Bravia. I can't seem to tell the TV to control my soundbar like I could with my old Sony through the ARC HDMI. Seems like something that should be pretty much standardized.
- Alexa is annoying. I turned off the voice detection so that it doesn't randomly interrupt video or audio.
- The power cord is too short if you have to plug it in to a normal outlet rather than one behind the TV. Mine barely reaches, but I can't hide it with the rest of my cords since it's off to the side and can't run down the center of the wall.
- The VESA spacing is really low. This only matters if you're swapping this TV for an old one and not changing mounts. But it is annoying, nonetheless, that I couldn't set the Omni as low as my old Sony was.

So if you don't expect 120+ frames a second for motion smoothing and don't expect a major sound improvement, this Omni is a great tv for a budget price!",B08T6F8YBH,Picture Perfect,Size: 77 inchStyle: TV Only,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I have this TV in my home gym and bought it for live television. I had bad issues with SlingTV from the start. The app didn't load properly, had to be restarted, and then video playback was horrible. I did find the Fire TV GUI a bit slow on this television, so I assumed the processor was just too weak and I gave it a scathing review. I spoke with customer support and then did additional testing with Prime Video, and I even streamed a 4K video to it over my home network. Everything played back flawlessly. I feel bad for the initial bad review, seeing as how it was actually the SlingTV app. I'm used to this app on a Fire TV Stick and Roku Ultra, so I thought it would function properly on the Fire TV. I was wrong!

This television has a good picture and acceptable sound for its price range (what TV really has great sound from the small speakers?). I still find the user interface a little slow, but updates and reboots did help. Again, this is a good TV for its price range. I think it is quite an exceptional deal when Amazon occasionally slashes the price.",B08T6F8YBH,You need very good internet service!!!,Size: 65 inchStyle: TV Only,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I just want to say first, I got this TV for $110 during a flash sale and for that price this TV is absolutely fantastic.

Otherwise though, it's a decent TV for the price. Picture quality is decent overall, and I like the remote. I personally love the integration with alexa which while not really necessary is a nice to have.

The software is what I don't love. The fireTV software is so much more responsive than any rokuTV i've used when just moving around or typing. However the actual software itself is not my favorite. I've used quite a few different smart TV OS's and this is the worst in terms of things just being unintuitive and having things in weird places, though this is remedied partially by the fact that you can just tell alexa to start or download your app.

So as a whole I don't love fireTV OS, but other than that this is a nice TV and alexa makes up for some of the inconveniences of the software.",B08T6F8YBH,very nice,Size: 55 inchStyle: TV Only,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought this tv for my brother who is disabled and cannot use his hands on the remote. I was told and as I looked at the reviews that this tv would recognize my cable network Comcast/Xfinity. As I went through the set up and went to settings, add equipment, the tv will only recognize ATT, Directv and another! After talking with tech support they said I had to purchase the Fire Cube in order for it to work with my cable company. With no luck the cube does nothing to change Alexa controlling the Xfinity cable box!! The tech support for Amazon nor Xfinity had no clue as to what I should do!

You can also talk to Alexa w/o having to talk into a stupid remote! lol.
But as for any 'negative' (so to speak), if you're really into specs and you're looking for a tv that runs at 120hz, or has dolby surround sound, then this tv isn't for you.

"I constantly have issues with the software making me regret buying a smart TV. My complaints
- It frequently hangs requiring me to pull the power out to reset it.
- Apps get stuck forcing me to clear the cache or force stop them.
- It's often slow to respond to the remote or Alexa commands
- Alexa itself stops listening every now and then. I'm forced to press the Alexa button on the remote to wake it up.
- Can't always use Alexa for screen prompts in apps, for example, skip intro in Netflix or HBO.
- Can't issue an Alexa command and use the remote at the same time.

It also annoys me to have Disney and Hulu buttons etc on the remote control. Completely. waste for me if I don't have them and wverytime I look at the remote it annoys me.

Since I had a fire stick and that is all I use for TV watching along with a ton of apps I thought I would give this a try because everything is built in including Alexa. What I like is Alexa works even when the TV is off. Unplugged my other Alexa and only use the one on the TV now in my bedroom, for lights and ceiling fan. The picture is crisp, clear, and has more memory for the apps. I shopped around for weeks, and this is the best price for a 65-inch 4k I have come across with the features it has.

"This TV is decent at best. The sound and picture quality are okay, nothing extremely special. The alexa integration is fine when it works. i never really use this because it takes a few seconds to recognize my voice and realizes i’m saying something to it. I find myself repeating myself when using the Alexa voice commands so i don’t really bother anymore. Another big thing about this TV is that the apps do not close when you hit the home button, you have to manually close out of the app for it to stop. For example if you’re watching a YouTube video and you click the home button, the youtube application will still be running in the background until you click it again and it will resume. you might think this is useful but due to this, the TV gets laggy and unresponsive like scrolling through the tiles gets laggy or turning up the volume takes a few seconds to register. in my opinion, the unresponsiveness and lag from the tv is a dealbreaker.",B08T6F8YBH,Works great out of the box,Size: 55-InchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Alexa integration?? Why can't I connect to my Echos as externsl speakers? This is ridiculous. I want to pipe the game through the house. I can't tell it to connect to ""Everywhere."" I can only connect via bluetooth, and ONLY ONE SPEAKER AT A TIME.
The only ""Alexa integration"" is you can use other Alexa devices as a remote control. But it has its own microphone so they don't actually do anything. IT IS NOT INTEGRATED WITH ANYTHING BUT ITSELF.
Another BAD audio problem: if I connect to my amplifier with an output cable, I can't use the TV speakers. So if I want to use the TV speakers, I have to PHYSICALLY UNPLUG the output cable from the TV. Why can't I just say ""Alexa, use internal speakers?"" GoogleTVs can use multiple Nest speakers AND remain connected to Google Home. Didn't Amazon invent this stuff?
In fact, I'd have to say ""Echo, use internal speakers,"" because it has a more sensitive microphone. I can be in the next room and say to a nearby Dot, ""Alexa, weather,"" and the FireTV switches from the last 45 seconds of the game to the weather app, I get yelled at, and I don't even get the weather report from the Echo Dot.

It's not as good as the Sony in the living room but live TV even sports it does very well. Anything you stream in 4k or 1080 looks outstanding. Seems to have a pretty fast processor. Using tivimate or kodi whatever you want to watch loads really fast, much faster than the 4k fire stick on the Sony. The Alexa feature works well for searching or even saying hey fire up a sleep timer for 30 minutes. All in all it's a great buy and have no real issues with it. Tweak the picture settings to your liking and you'll enjoy it. I have all the picture aids off like smoothing and everything. The sound is also impressive for just TV speakers.

My only complaint is the ups man who was acting shifty on giving me my tv said no one was home the first time when he tried to leave it and said he left a slip my mom watched him look at her and drive off then he tried to do the same thing with my husband the next day it didn't work cuz my husband stopped his truck and then he looked sad when he had to unload it so I don't know if he was just being lazy or trying to steal it by saying it got lost on its way back to amazon since ups only tries to deliver twice before sending it back. So make sure someone's home watching for it cuz some ppl r dishonest. It comes in a fire tv marked box so there's no guessing what's in it. Altogether I love the tv so far packaging removal wasn't a Hassel, set up is normal if you already have smart devices in your home like I do then setting up is even easier since you can link it to your other amazon devices. Plus 300 for a 4k 55 inch is a really good price. It took me 15 minutes max for set up probably closer to ten. The rest of the ppl on here complaining need to realize you got a 300 dollar 55 inch tv.

You didn't spend 1000 on a large tv u got a cheap 55 inch and as such I do give it five stars because price is on point, you can control the device using your voice without a remote, image is good, it's very responsive and not slow on load so you get what you pay for if you want to complain about little things get a more expensive tv.",B08T6F8YBH,Shipped a 720p Non-Smart TV,Size: 55-InchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars

"This 70-inch Samsung Tv so far (a few days) meets may expectations regarding its picture and (somehow) its sound quality. I spent considerable time on adjusting tv settings to meet my expectations and I have achieved my goal, for you can control/adjust basically all aspects of the Tv picture, motion, sound, etc. However, this TV remote/pilot is quite annoying. It has minimum options to control, and it is difficult to use in a dark room (its buttons are not lit). Also, the Tv software/program annoyingly wants you to go on the internet and purchase/join some networks/providers. For my, using the cable provider, Spectrum, it is unnecessary policy of the Samsung. In essence, every time you turn on this TV it start with the Samsung Tv Plus, with icons of all these Netfixes, Hulus, Amazons, etc, plus your provider. However, there is a way to disable this defaulted preference and start your TV with the picture of the location where you have been when turned off TV. After a two more weeks:
A problem with the so called ""pink screen"" developed. Basically, from time to time, when my TV was turned on it displayed just a pink screen with no picture nor any sound. I contacted a Samsung support which is overseas, of course. They made a record of my TV issue and accepted my photo of its pink screen. They said, it was due to the weak or disrupted/corrupted video signal, HDMI connection between the source and TV. However, upon plugin it in and out and in again, apparently, my HDMI cable was not causing this problem. After researching the internet I decided to call my Spectrum cable provider. To my surprise, the technician was quite familiar with this issue, and remotely tuned my cable box (HDR). Upon his tuning, my TV screen turned to have WAY better picture quality (!) and he promised me that the pink screen will never show on my screen again. So, now I have a way better picture, practically ideal quality. Also, I keep my fingers crossed that this pink screen will never pay me a visit.

One complaint on this is that some of the smart features are not excellent.

For example, on the remote, there are several buttons to open up Netflix/Prime/Disney+ etc. but there's no way to change where those buttons lead. So for someone like me, who uses Hulu more often than anything else, the only other direct option is to use the microphone, which frequently misunderstands me- as most voice activated things do. I also wish I could use the voice commands to go directly to one show (ie ""open X FIles on Hulu"" vs. ""Open Hulu""...*Opens Hulu*... *type in name of show/scroll*)

We even connected it to our Google Home, but even still, the voice commands are limited in what they can do and it's usually just faster to do it manually.

The remote, I confess, takes a bit to get used to, but in two days I was good using it. And I already know that, It will take a while discovering new features and no matter how much I find out, I'll barely be scratching the surface of what one can get from this tv! Gee, there are so many features to explore. I can't get over it.
To stream all my movies I have an array of free movie sites and a ton of other sites one can subscribe to. I can also download any site if not already in the enormous list of movie channels. Samsung offers ""News Channels"" to keep you updated with the world daily news.
But you can always download TubiTv-for free movies and free ""Live News""-- it wasn't in the ""apps home list"", but I downloaded it. As well as I downloaded the ""BritBox"" I subscribe to. WOW! Watching ""Shetland"", ""Vera""or ""Midsomer Murders"" etc... on this tv is like have yourself going for a walk in the movie set of those British countryside scene. It's soooo live, the image pops out of the screen at you.
I can also go to the internet browser, (after connecting a keyboard to this tv) and shop, research, write emails or do my fiction book writing and save it all to my email ""drafts"" file.
Ah, you can also connect your phone to the tv and answer it when ringing if you use a wireless pair of ear pod (a Bluetooth I paid only $23+tx online, have owned it and gifted several throughout the last 3yrs), just as I use with my computer, no tv noise from lowd music or movies to the neighbors!

"The picture quality is phenomenal. I got this because it was the cheapest 2022 Samsung model I could find that could run the XBOX app (cloud gamining without using a physical xbox).
A hardcore gamer who plays competeitve first person shooters might want to go for a higher model...like the Q80B, because that has VRR and 120Hz). But for people who are just playing Final Fantasy, Assassin's Creed, and Minecraft this is just fine, because the difference are minimal to non competitive gamers. It would costs hundreds more for a smaller size of the higher level models.
The sound quality is good and I don't feel inclinded to get a soundbar. It's lightweight and thin, so I was able to set it up myself as a petite woman. It was easy to navigate the menus and setup everything. It auto detected all gaming devices I plugged into the HDMI ports and added the icons to the gaming center section. Customer service responds within seconds on the samsung site for any questions. My only complaint was the annoying bloatware Samsung TV app that auoplayed random TV episdodes everytime I turned the TV on. Easy fix, long press on it and select ""disable"". Oh, and the remote charges by solar energy (either your ceiling lights or sunlight!). I found the viewing experience so pleasant, that I re-watched some movies I already saw in the past, just to see them in upgraded graphics.

"I’ve purchased several Samsung TV’s and I am very disappointed with this purchase.

I’ve had my TV 3 weeks and I’m returning.

Out of the box, the picture looked good, but had issues connecting my Apple TV 4K.

In short, I’ve replaced the Apple TV for a new one, replaced 3 HDMI cables and tried various ports.

Sometimes my Apple TV works, sometimes the image blinks on and off and sometimes the picture if full of static.

The remote sucks too.

UPDATE:

I had decided to return this TV. The night before my scheduled return I reset the TV. Once I completed the reset everything worked perfectly.

I cancelled my return and I’m very happy with my purchase. I’ve gotten used the the remote. It isn’t that bad.

I have used this size for desktop applications for years now and this is just the latest iteration for me. I love the 43in size for productivity as I can have four good sized windows open at any time and quickly move between them. I was worried that my potato of a work provided laptop would not run the 4k screen (and the provided docking station did not) but with some work I got a thunderbolt dock hooked up and was good for the full 4k 60p. I know that this size is not for everyone but for me I looked at a lot of different options even ended up with the 49in ultra wide in my cart at one point but the price of this is unbeatable. You could spend $1000 dollars on an ultrawide or you could get this for less than $400 I mean it is hard to make any other decision really. Now on to how it looks. it is not super bright or extra deep colors but for office work it is perfect in my book. I also own the new 42in oled for home use and it is no comparison the oled thrashes this in every possible metric but it is also nearly three times the price so it better. My only real gripe with these screens is that at arms distance away the corners get a bit soft. This is not a deal breaker but you will find your self shifting to find the close button in the far right corner from time to time. A tiny bit of curve to the panel would solve this but that is a bit of a pipe dream. All in all this is a five star product for the price and I can not recommend this enough for power users that need a little bit of extra space.,B09RRVKN12,Order was fulfilled perfectly. Very happy.

"I have had this TV a couple of weeks now so I've had time to see how it fits into my life. First of all, I am a 77-year old woman living alone and I was able to set it up completely by myself. The directions were straight forward and easy to follow. The hardest part was putting the feet on because the screws were black and the insertion points were also black. The actual set up of the programming was amazingly easy. Most apps or features I wanted on the Home Screen could be set up using a QR code which then went to your account for features like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Apple TV and others. No complicated setup was required. I really appreciated that!

I love the Home Screen. At first I wasn't sure I'd like it but as I've used it I've come to love that it gives me all kinds of options as soon as I turn it on. I even set it up to give me weather in my area. If I want to go to Netflix or even Apple TV I just click on that option and I'm good to go. If I want to access the Home Screen of my satellite dish provider, I just click on HDMI1 and it takes me there.

There is also a feature that allows you to use Alexa to find things but I haven't done much with that yet. It sounds like it will be fun to explore though.

"First thing one should appreciate, is the sheer size of the item. Massive at 65"". The box arrived by Amazon freight at 6:30 am, but it was worth it because I feared it would be left in lobby which is not secure.
The box is massive and quite tall.

Set up requires a minimum 2 able bodied people. The box pops open on the side with some light pressure and the TV is there for all to see. Picture quality is impressive and will show non-HD images well enough with very little pixelation. HD and 4K signals are crystal clear and dynamic.

The remote is easy to navigate and only a little intimidating at first. It is actually set up rather simple, but I can appreciate this. The options on the screen are numerous, but navigating is simple. Take from me a non-technical person on any level.

Connects easily to sound bar with minimal fuss. I got it for cable and movies, so I don't use the Wi-Fi and smart options. It may be a smart TV but I'm a dumb guy, so that's that.

I would recommend the product and the freight was spot on. Was concerned I'd get a tv with cracks or dead spots in screen. This was not the case, and I am grateful. The price point can't be beat, I know because I searched. Amazon has some of the best policies of any company so ordering from them is a no brainer.

"This 70-inch Samsung Tv so far (a few days) meets may expectations regarding its picture and (somehow) its sound quality. I spent considerable time on adjusting tv settings to meet my expectations and I have achieved my goal, for you can control/adjust basically all aspects of the Tv picture, motion, sound, etc. However, this TV remote/pilot is quite annoying. It has minimum options to control, and it is difficult to use in a dark room (its buttons are not lit). Also, the Tv software/program annoyingly wants you to go on the internet and purchase/join some networks/providers. For my, using the cable provider, Spectrum, it is unnecessary policy of the Samsung. In essence, every time you turn on this TV it start with the Samsung Tv Plus, with icons of all these Netfixes, Hulus, Amazons, etc, plus your provider. However, there is a way to disable this defaulted preference and start your TV with the picture of the location where you have been when turned off TV. After a two more weeks:
A problem with the so called ""pink screen"" developed. Basically, from time to time, when my TV was turned on it displayed just a pink screen with no picture nor any sound. I contacted a Samsung support which is overseas, of course. They made a record of my TV issue and accepted my photo of its pink screen. They said, it was due to the weak or disrupted/corrupted video signal, HDMI connection between the source and TV. However, upon plugin it in and out and in again, apparently, my HDMI cable was not causing this problem. After researching the internet I decided to call my Spectrum cable provider. To my surprise, the technician was quite familiar with this issue, and remotely tuned my cable box (HDR). Upon his tuning, my TV screen turned to have WAY better picture quality (!) and he promised me that the pink screen will never show on my screen again. So, now I have a way better picture, practically ideal quality. Also, I keep my fingers crossed that this pink screen will never pay me a visit. Also, I wonder, why this TV was not packed at its factory with a decent manual brochure clearly explaining all these issues to the clients.",B09V6GHWDJ,We love our TV,Size: 65Style: TV Only,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought this TV to become the centerpiece above my fireplace in my large Great Room.
Turns out that this Samsung is perfect in every way. Not one complaint.
You can stand one foot from the screen and see not one pixel. Yet relax in the couch 20 feet away and still a perfect picture with rich, vibrant colors. It's also quite smart, acting more like a PC with tons of options to adjust, control and see virtually anything streaming, on my spectrum cable, or online via the web. Takes a bit of a learning curve working with this unit in order to get a full handle on everything this TV can do, but well worth the effort.

"We've had this TV for about 1 month now and so far it's a pretty good TV. The images are sharp and vibrant, sound quality is what you'd expect of TV speakers- clear enough, gets loud enough.

One complaint on this is that some of the smart features are not excellent.

For example, on the remote, there are several buttons to open up Netflix/Prime/Disney+ etc. but there's no way to change where those buttons lead. So for someone like me, who uses Hulu more often than anything else, the only other direct option is to use the microphone, which frequently misunderstands me- as most voice activated things do. I also wish I could use the voice commands to go directly to one show (ie ""open X FIles on Hulu"" vs. ""Open Hulu""...*Opens Hulu*... *type in name of show/scroll*)

We even connected it to our Google Home, but even still, the voice commands are limited in what they can do and it's usually just faster to do it manually.

Still though, I really can't complain. it's pretty decent overall and once I start playing my shows, it's usually smooth sailing.",B09V6GHWDJ,Smoking deal,Size: 55Style: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars

"Excellent tv. It arrived really fast. WOW!!! Best picture, it is so LIVE! Set up was easy&fast. FYI I don't have cable service, just internet. The remote, I confess, takes a bit to get used to, but in two days I was good using it. And I already know that, It will take a while discovering new features and no matter how much I find out, I'll barely be scratching the surface of what one can get from this tv! Gee, there are so many features to explore. I can't get over it.
To stream all my movies I have an array of free movie sites and a ton of other sites one can subscribe to. I can also download any site if not already in the enormous list of movie channels. Samsung offers ""News Channels"" to keep you updated with the world daily news.
But you can always download TubiTv-for free movies and free ""Live News""-- it wasn't in the ""apps home list"", but I downloaded it. As well as I downloaded the ""BritBox"" I subscribe to. WOW! Watching ""Shetland"", ""Vera""or ""Midsomer Murders"" etc... on this tv is like have yourself going for a walk in the movie set of those British countryside scene. It's soooo live, the image pops out of the screen at you.
I can also go to the internet browser, (after connecting a keyboard to this tv) and shop, research, write emails or do my fiction book writing and save it all to my email ""drafts"" file.
Ah, you can also connect your phone to the tv and answer it when ringing if you use a wireless pair of ear pod (a Bluetooth I paid only $23+tx online, have owned it and gifted several throughout the last 3yrs), just as I use with my computer, no tv noise from lowd music or movies to the neighbors! I don't know what else can I ask for, we'll, I am still discovering new functions in this incredible tv! I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS TV!
So happy I got it, and for a senior like me on a low SS pension, the 5pmts installments from Amazon suit my budget perfectly, in fact, it made all possible to buy this tv and other things for my new housing studio apt I recently moved to! That's why I always come back to Amazon for all my purchase needs!

"Woke up this morning at 7am and saw that package was sitting outside my front door in Florida, within one day of order placement. Amazing Amazon. Opened up the package, hooked up the HDMI from my Dell desktop PC and DVD Player within minutes. Started up the setup procedure. The Samsung 43""Q60B picked up my network, the PC, all my Samsung TV Plus settings from my 75""Q80A in the living room; the DVD Player; as well as my Samsung account settings automatically as it showed up in the main menu listing. It's as if this TV read my mind. Need I say more folks?

Excellent picture quality out of the box as well as the sound. For the PC, I set the picture to Warm2. Desktop will show up automatically every time I turn the TV on.

"The picture quality is phenomenal. I got this because it was the cheapest 2022 Samsung model I could find that could run the XBOX app (cloud gamining without using a physical xbox).
A hardcore gamer who plays competeitve first person shooters might want to go for a higher model...like the Q80B, because that has VRR and 120Hz). But for people who are just playing Final Fantasy, Assassin's Creed, and Minecraft this is just fine, because the difference are minimal to non competitive gamers. It would costs hundreds more for a smaller size of the higher level models.
The sound quality is good and I don't feel inclinded to get a soundbar. It's lightweight and thin, so I was able to set it up myself as a petite woman. It was easy to navigate the menus and setup everything. It auto detected all gaming devices I plugged into the HDMI ports and added the icons to the gaming center section. Customer service responds within seconds on the samsung site for any questions. My only complaint was the annoying bloatware Samsung TV app that auoplayed random TV episdodes everytime I turned the TV on. Easy fix, long press on it and select ""disable"". Oh, and the remote charges by solar energy (either your ceiling lights or sunlight!). I found the viewing experience so pleasant, that I re-watched some movies I already saw in the past, just to see them in upgraded graphics.

"I’ve purchased several Samsung TV’s and I am very disappointed with this purchase.

I’ve had my TV 3 weeks and I’m returning.

Out of the box, the picture looked good, but had issues connecting my Apple TV 4K.

In short, I’ve replaced the Apple TV for a new one, replaced 3 HDMI cables and tried various ports.

Sometimes my Apple TV works, sometimes the image blinks on and off and sometimes the picture if full of static.

The remote sucks too.

UPDATE:

I had decided to return this TV. The night before my scheduled return I reset the TV. Once I completed the reset everything worked perfectly.

I cancelled my return and I’m very happy with my purchase. I’ve gotten used the the remote. It isn’t that bad.

One of the Amazon answers days this TV doesn't support 4K @ 120hz for gaming but it actually does, as confirmed by my Xbox Series X settings menu.

"Bought this TV to replace a 6 year old Samsung. Very happy with it.
As others have said, if you want the best TV to hook up your $1500 gaming pc to or play the best of the best Xbox series X games on at the highest settings, you can find better tvs (for a lot more money)

But if you want a very good TV to watch sports, streaming, movies and regular shows, this is great.

I'm a bit puzzled as to why others said the TV sound is bad. We have another 4-5 year old TCL tv, and this tv sounds much better. We even have a $200 sound bar hooked up to the old tv....I tried hooking that soundbar up to this TV and it was only a slight improvement over the speakers in the TV.
Of course, buy yourself an expensive soundbar or one with a seperate subwoofer and it will sound better, but this TV for sure sounds better than similar TVs just a couple years old.

The Biggest thing I was concerned about was the Roku smart TV features. We have a Cable app built in (as we did on our old Samsung TV) and it responded VERY slowly on the Samsung. Happy to say it is much quicker on the TV.

In the menu it does have various settings so you can get the picture quality to just how you like it (color temp, color level, brightness/contrast, sharpness, etc) and has a few different sound settings built in also you can change between.

I have bought TV's in the past that I returned because I simply did not like something about them. not this one, this is a very good entry/mid level TV for the price.",B09R786CJ9,Great TV!,Size: 65-InchStyle: Google TV,3.0 out of 5 stars
"This is our second TCL TV. We bought a 55 inch TCL about four years ago and it has been an outstanding unit. Around the same time we bought a 50 inch Sharp Roku TV that honestly neither of us was ever 100% happy with. It just seemed very unstable and glitchy with the controls and the picture wasn’t that great either.

This TCL arrived in a timely manner the box was perfect and the TV was very easy to unpack and set up. Probably less than 20 minutes. The sound is good the picture is very good.

The one and only thing I would improve relates to the one feature of the Sharp TV that I really did like. There is only one audio out jack which is for headphones. When you plug in headphones the built-in speakers are unenabled. That was one nice feature of the sharp TV, it had a direct audio out and a separate headphone jack so I could listen on my headphones while my wife listened on the speakers because my hearing is not as good as hers. Other than that one thing we are very happy with the TCL unit and would recommend it .",B09R786CJ9,Nice picture,Size: 65-InchStyle: Google TV,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Might not be the best picture quality available, but it is pretty dang good. If you are upgrading from an older TV (5ys+ old) this picture will be incredible to you. I have recently purchased a 55"" Sony Bravo as well (the connectivity options and sound quality on the Bravo are far better) and when I first got it, I had them side-by-side and honestly thought the TCL had a better picture with my HD cable. Blu-ray, I couldn't see a difference. In short, buy a high quality sound bar (ARC) for this TV and you are still at half the price of the comparably-size Bravo. Fantastic deal. This review will probably upset the electronic snobs out there, but most people don't care that there are 10 picture settings in a TV and aren't going to take the time to switch the setting depending on every viewing situation they are in.

"Hoping this helps with your decisions.

So, wish we had vid/pic the product to post along with this review. Package was in the simple original carton only. That said, UPS handled it very well as there were zero damage or wear to the carton at all & we gladly accepted the delivery.
The carton gave instructions on how to open the TV the easiest and safest. It was inner wrapped in plastic with an additional thick foam and cardboard shield between the carton and protected screen.
Every item was attached to find easily & no loss or damage.

The set itself is a great economical entry/midrange tv. Picture is on par and the bundled Roku software lends many viewing options. Wireless network setup on TV is easy especially bc we knew our password. Its not clear if any push to connect option was available as we don’t allow that option on our residential wireless. Hardwire network option is available, though our wireless is substantial to hold and serve many endpoints.
Updates were automatically verified and then the Roku app setup begins with simple date time and zipcode verification. If you are familiar it is identical as a external Roku setup. If not familiar, Roku is easy to navigate and select or deselect channels and setup.
You will find 4 HDMI ports one supporting (ARC). If you aren’t familiar with hdmi(arc) devices, suggest you Google else you will miss out on a optional device interface, like controlling a sound bar.
Speaking of sound bar… my only “con” about this set is the rather ‘cheap’ sound it produces by itself. Actually the sound isn’t too bad for a down and back firing sound. I assume the reason for the speaker position is more for wall mounting (not included) and provide a sleek frontal look with a equally 1/2” ‘borderless appearance.
If you plan to use the factory feet/stand just know your lower clearance is around 2” from bottom of set to your counter, tv stand top. Making the audio sound seem a little strange, however you will acclimate to the bass lacking internal sound.
The set itself, it is rather light in comparison to older LCD/LED/Plasma.
A feature beyond a cable box remote controller, enjoyed by our family is the direct ability to adjust volume from the simple Roku remote included.
All in all…this is an excellent value. It’s not a set to ‘crow about up and down the neighborhood, on NFL superbowl weekend HOWEVER you will not be embarrassed by this set in anyway. Kid to the in-laws will love it.

Recommend: Consider a sound bar which are also offered at reasonable $ by same manufacturer & for just this TV model.

I am also really pleased with Roku. Prior to this I had a smart TV that was not Roku. It really adds a lot of different channels and free apps for infinite things to view. If you have app subscriptions already you can just sign in, it doesn't charge you extra. It also loads really quickly.
As far as regular cable TV I haven't figured out how to pause, rewind, fast forward or any other features yet, which were advertised with the Roku program.

"The TCL roku tv is the best interface on earth for cord cutters. Why? Because once you hook this tv to a good antenna, you will not only get a great picture but a menu. Not just any menu to view what is on tv right now, but a menu to show you what is coming up. TCL is so high tech for cord cutters, by adding a USB drive to the tv you can pause live tv. This is amazing. imagine watching your favorite show but you need a bathroom break. Just press pause and when you come back you can resume. What an amazing free feature. Now if you have internet in your home you will also get free tv channels. At least a hundred free stations that are a part of your guide. Its basically like having basic cable without a monthly fee. The tv will pay for itself in 12 months. About the sound, it is high end sound. You can use headphones and a sound bar but the sound is really good and immersive. About the picture, I suggest you go to sports mode. Go to settings and put it on sports mode because it will be operating in 120 motion mode and the picture quality is great and bright with great contrast. You will get your best picture in sports mode. The best sound is when you go to sound settings and combine the bass with enhanced sound for speech. it is just a button click. In my opinion, if you are a cord cutter a TCL tv has the best combination of features, sound and picture quality. I have owned other brands and still do, but NOTHING compares to a TCL for a true cord cutter. NOTHING! Nothing beats newer tvs because it is made for a cord cutter.

I replaced a 55 inch LG which simply stopped working. I had been doing research on new flat screens because the LG was acting funny and I wanted to be prepared. I had a ROKU device attached to the LG so the choice of a ROKU TV was a given. I do like the O.S. and user interface.
Pretty plain, but that’s the nature of all flat screens. It’s simple plain plastic frame with nothing taking up screen real estate. There is a button on the front bottom that allows control of the device if you lose the remote. I bought a spare non OEM remote for $5.00, I would recommend it. The remote combined with the ROKU interface has a lot of options in spite of the remote only having a few buttons. I do miss numbers on the remote however.
So the weirdness is the default settings. When I turned it on the initial impression was the screen was not bright and actually kind of flat and boring. After learning all the settings I found one that was set to “low power.” I flipped it to “normal” and a brilliant picture showed up. The same goes for the sound. I set that to theater and a clear more dynamic sound arrived. I don’t know why TCL would set a default to a sub optional setting, but they did. Of course the product literature was of limited value, just had to experiment.

Would work well with cable.,B09F3TW5CP,"wonderful product , yet to test its aging",Size: 50-inch,5.0 out of 5 stars
"My wife sent me the listing for this TV when she received it as a special sale item and even though my current old TV was still working fine, I decided that it was a good enough deal that I would upgrade to 4K finally. I liked that it had a lot of potentially beneficial connectivity between other devices, like cameras and other smart home stuff. I already had a TV wall mount from my old TV. The only problem was the mounting holes on the back of this TV were different and I didn't have the leftovers from the mounting hardware, so I had to wait until the next morning to run to the hardware store and get what I needed. After that, it was up on the wall within minutes. Another problem: the mounting of the bracket on the back on the TV is much lower than my old one, so the TV sits about 8-10"" higher than before. I will need to take down the TV and move the entire wall bracket down so it sits at the right height.

Setup is pretty easy, getting through the general stuff, the WiFi connection, updates, and scanning through the TV channels...yes, I still use antenna for a couple local channels I can't get through streaming. That all went fine. I connected my existing in-wall HDMI cable to the ARC port and set my receiver to the Roku input. I had great picture and audio. I decided that I should also try using the TV with its built-in Fire TV capabilities.

That's where things went off the rails. The ARC was working fine for all of a few minutes, and then after changing a couple unrelated settings and rebooting the TV, I had no more sound over ARC. I messed with settings on the TV and my receiver for 10-15 minutes before turning to the internet for help. I found an answer that said to unplug the TV for a few minutes and then it should work again. Great. Did that and I did indeed have sound over the ARC channel, but it would cut out every 5-7 seconds. I tried messing with all sorts of settings but eventually gave up and just connected an optical cable between the TV and receiver to get sound working properly. I might have to try a newer HDMI cable to see if that makes any difference.

With that working, I was able to use the native Fire TV apps. I've been using the native Fire TV system now for a couple months and I have to say, it needs work. When the apps work, they work. But every once in a while, and it's happening almost daily now, I'll load an app and it won't respond. I'll have to reboot the TV and then the apps will start working most of the time. Sometimes even a reboot won't work and I just have to wait for the app to eventually load. I don't think its an internet or WiFi issue, since nothing else seems to have any problems. I just think the Fire TV environment is slow. I don't know if it's because of the hardware or the software, but the instant I started using it, I could tell how much slower it was to respond to anything compared to the Roku box I have.

Needless to say, as a display, this thing works great. The picture is clear and bright, the details are amazing. I haven't played much with the picture settings, as out-of-box, it was already good. I like that it integrates the OTA TV channels right into the menu so I don't have to change the input. I also like the on-screen notifications from Alexa for specific things that I have set up. I haven't played much with the integration of the Ring doorbell and the picture-in-picture display for it. I also plugged a web camera into the USB port on the TV and it recognized it, but I haven't tried to use Zoom yet with it.

I gave it 5 stars, despite the issues with ARC, as that may not necessarily be the fault of the manufacturer, but more an issue with my cable, or the setup between the TV and my receiver...maybe they just don't work well together. I've read that Yamaha's receivers all tend to be finicky with ARC, so it may just be that. I'm also not dropping any stars, despite the speed issues, as it could potentially be related to my network, or might work fine after an update. Either way, I could use it as just a display with my Roku and it would be a 5-star display at that point. But then I'd lose any capabilities with the integrated Alexa and smart features.",B08T6DZ81T,I love it; except for the sleep mode,Size: 50-inch,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Not very smart. With terrible support. Even though I was an audio/videophile, when I could afford it, and even though this TV is not OLED, I am extremely pleased with the TV, picture-wise (plus I got it on sale for $299,which helps expectations). The sound is acceptable, until I can augment with external speakers. I can hear it just fine and there's enough audio settings, esp voice enhancing, to set it to hear around my apt. I have it on its stand, on a table, so there's room for the sound to reflect off the table. If you wall mount it, this will not be true, so may be6much quieter. But it's much better than I thought and the sound approximates as home theater-ish as it can (not much, granted!). The preset EQ is terrible. There's no separate bass, treble, mid settings.

I have had no trouble running the TV with and casting from my 2yr old Motorola Android phone. From every streaming service app. Set up was easy, after I got the hang of a smart TV, and I easily downloaded the TV and phone apps and logged into all my streaming accounts.

I was bothered that there weren't many video settings but as of yesterday's significant software update, there's more. But if you don't want to be bothered, it's certainly acceptable set as delivered, or using the many video presets.

The bad: I can't mirror from my desktop computer to the TV. My research shows that only Intel Pentium 4th generation processors will reliably connect. I have a 3rd generation (Sandy Bridge) processor, and even though it did connect, with some issues, for about 3min, it hasn't since. While Mirrorcast, included with Windows running on a Sandy Bridge processor, may successfully mirror to your TV, it *very* well may not. This is all Wi-Fi. I have yet to try using an HDMI cable and using the TV as a 2nd monitor. Or buying a Chromecast device, which is even more money. But gamers be cautious (I am not a gamer, per se, but I would love to run my Second Life virtual world on a 50"" screen!). I have to send movies I own or home video clips, etc, to YouTube, in order to watch on the TV. This takes forever, esp if HD or UHD. Like 12+hrs to process if UHD. I need to update my DVD player but why should I have to. Why wasn't the info about the processors front and center on the sales info? I only think it's recently on the TV support page. Not sure about AMD machines and don't remember what it said about Mac, but I don't think it was good. Check it on Amazon mirroring page for this TV.

Even though I went crazy searching the internet for a cure for mirroring, most info is for a Firestck and not FireTV. Similar but not the same. The Amazon support pages are a brief joke.

I finally, before giving up mirroring, called support yesterday. I've worked support (granted, developer support) and I was shocked. I knew way more than she did, and she was obviously using the internet or a database, for the simplest of questions, which I can do! Her TV simulator had a whole different menu than the TV! And it took me 5min to convince her (how hard is ""My menu doesn't have that."" to understand?). I was hoping to escalate the call to a more technical tier, but, after a ridiculous conversation all I could get was a supervisor. The supervisor was much *more* knowledgeable, but still not the TECHNICAL support I was after. I don't want to be told, ""The software won't connect on your machine."" Which software? Why won't it work? How do you know my computer and what's on it? Plus it was a HARDWARE issue. I actually found the processor info while on hold while they Googled their answers. So I guess the call wasn't a waste... TBF, these ladies were *incredibly* patient and nice. Even called me back when the call got dropped. If you have a simple issue, they would be ok, if you can get past the things I've mentioned. English was most excellent.

I'll spare you my rant about a big company like Amazon should be able to field at least minimal support. Esp for expensive and smart products. I will never buy an big tech Amazon brand again.

Even though I am happy with the TV, only as a TV, I dinged 2 stars for terrible support, the hidden mirroring info, and the difficult software and user interface. As a former software developer, it's like it was written by 12yr old interns. It's really important that you are able to control and cast the TV from your phone, for the best experience.

There's also no way to display the time/date on the screen, without rooting the TV and running software! Even my 80s TVs and VCRs could do that, with one on/off setting, and reliably set sleep time! Setting sleep time, screensaver options, and such is broken, although I did notice that the quick sleep timer is working better since the update. Settings are very confusing. Nothing seems like it's where it should be, esp on the big gear menu from the Home screen. The remote settings overlay (from remote) is slightly better but menus arranged differently. Oh, and the teenie, tiny remote really stinks, but I have a remote control phone app which helps, although not worth it just to do volume and other simple things. Again, if not for my phone, this TV would be far less enjoyable.

As of this review, I've owned the TV for a month, with heavy use, with no malfunctions. Knock wood, and I hope it lasts as long as the 24 payments. I am a senior lady with health issues, but was able to unpack, screw on the stand, and set it up myself. It was very hard on me, but there was no one else here to do it. I was using it within 20min. Very A/V tech literate, though.

I've been watching it with glee, coming from years of having to use my 24"" 1080p computer monitor. If I had owned big modern TVs before, this might be a 1star review. It's far lower in overall quality, in every way, (granted, much cheaper) than my 90s Sony big screen TV, even with its limited resolution. Lighter and smaller, though, even though same size. Hope this helps someone!",B08T6DZ81T,"Terrible speakers, good picture quality",Size: 50-inch,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I have a significant investment in Amazon Fire TV Cubes (3) and Sticks (6) and so I decided to try out the Amazon Fire TV (43 Inch Omni). This is for my master bedroom and is not my main viewing TV. I also own an LG 55 inch C6 (OLED), a 65 inch LG 9000 (IPS panel) and a 55 inch Hisense U8G (VA panel) which are fairly high end TV’s that all have above average picture quality and upscale functionality.

The Omni TV does not compare to my main TV’s in picture quality, however, the 4K picture is actually quite decent for a bedroom TV whose main viewing time is either early morning or late evening (in a darkened room). Also, we don’t have any soundbars, DVD players, or Cable boxes attached to the Omni TV. We use YouTube TV for local channels and have a number of streaming services (Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, etc.).

What I like about the Omni TV
1. Very lightweight at 15.5 pounds making it easy to mount on the wall.
2. Set up was extremely easy since I am a registered Amazon customer. Plug it in, answer a few questions the TV does a software update, linked to my saved settings for WiFi, automatically downloaded my previous applications from my Fire TV Stick and it was ready to go.
3. The interface is exactly like all my other Fire TV Sticks and Cubes, there was no learning curve. The interface is zippy and functions well. After loading 30+ applications I still had 6 GB of memory unused, which is great. I was also able to jailbreak the TV (like the Fire TV Stick) and download Kodi, Cinema HD, Downloader, IP Vanish, and several other 3rd party utilities, with no problem. All applications work great.
4. Based on the integrated voice and Fire TV capability, you don’t need to spend $50 on a FireTV Max or $100 on a Fire TV Cube and a $30 Echo Dot, making the TV an even greater value.
5. The Bluetooth remote is a nice design and easy to use. A bit of an enhancement over the base Fire TV stick remote with some controls unique to the Omni TV (like settings, channel selector, prior key, live TV key)
6. The integrated voice commands worked for the most part. Actually, this is pretty cool and should only get better over time. I do have one issue where Voice Commands such as “Turn on the TV” work just fine, but “Turn Off the TV” does not work. This is a minor issue and hopefully will get fixed with future software updates. Note: Amazon customer service could not find a resolution to this problem other than resetting my TV and wiping out all my downloaded applications/passwords. I elected to live with the problem. All other commands seem to work well.
7. The 4K picture quality is acceptable in the bedroom.
8. The price is excellent. At $300 for the 43-inch TV, it was priced appropriately for the functionality.
9. Once you get used to how to tweak the picture using the Picture Mode function (Standard, Movie, Dynamic, Custom) settings you can improve the quality of the picture a bit. For me, the Movie mode, with Picture Temp set to Warm 1 worked best for me. Compared to other TV’s the number of adjustments are very limited. However, for ease of use for most users, this is probably acceptable. I do like using voice commands to “Switch Picture Mode to Standard, Movie, Dynamic, etc.”. This saves clicking the remote button multiple times and is easier to execute.
10. Integration to my Ring Doorbell and 4 cameras around my property works great. The Omni TV supports either full screen as well as Picture in Picture and is voice-activated. “Show me the Front Yard Camera” is all that is needed to bring up the picture….very easy to do.
11. All my TP-Link KASA smart plugs can be activated via voice through the Omni TV, i.e. “Turn on the bedroom lights”., “Turn off my backyard landscape lights”, etc.
12. Drop-in works across other Echo Dots.
13. The Omni TV can participate in standard “Speaker Groups”. i.e. “Play music Upstairs” works.
14. You can control attached Sound Bars, DVD players, and Cable boxes with this TV (like the Fire TV Cube). With 4HDMI ports, you have a lot of expansion capabilities. It comes with an IR blaster that can be used for non-bluetooth devices.
15. You can attach up to two Echo Dots to this TV to improve the sound quality. In my opinion, the sound quality on this set is ok for a bedroom. Not great, but not bad either. After all, it is a bedroom!!
16. The 43 inch size is perfect for a bedroom TV. Bumping up to a 50 or 55 inch TV would have been too big for my space. Not all TV manufacturers offer this size.

What I don’t like about the Fire TV
1. The lack of Dolby Vision and HDR 10+ limits the 4K picture quality. Dolby Vision should have been included in all the TV’s and not just the 65 and 75 inch models.
2. The backlighting is very basic with direct-lit. I would have paid more to get Full Array backlighting to enhance picture quality.
3. Good HDR requires much higher NITs - I.e. brightness (like 500 to 600) to be truly effective. The Omni TV seems to top out around 325, which is not enough to make HDR details pop in a dark scene.
4. The VA Panel has poor side viewing angles (most all vendors have this problem) but in my bedroom, this was not a problem.

All in all, I would recommend this TV if you want a decent 4K picture for a bedroom, want to save some bucks, and are invested in the Amazon echo system. The price is great for what you get and you don’t need to purchase a Fire TV and Echo Dot to gain voice control with another TV brand.

For the main viewing area, I would pay more for a larger higher quality TV that supports Dolby Vision, Full Array backlighting, better-upscaling processor, and higher HDR peak brightness.

UPDATE 5/2/22 FIX for TV not shutting down by voice command
I was able to solve the voice problem of why the Omni TV's Alexa would ""Turn on the TV"" but fail to ""Turn off the TV"" (it would always go back to the home screen and never shut down). The solution was to go into the Alexa App on my Phone - Select Devices, then - Select All Devices - Find my Omni TV in the device list - Select the Omni TV then TURN OFF Two items 1) Adaptive Listening and 2) Follow up Mode. The minute I made these two changes the TV will now turn off using my voice. Many of my Echo Dots have these features turned on so I made the assumption that the Omni TV would work the same way since these features are available. That was a wrong assumption. My guess is when you have the Follow Up mode turned on, during the shut down process, Alexa gets confused and is waiting for a follow up command (so it does not shut down). In my opinion this is a software bug. I am surprised that Amazon support does not have this easy fix in their knowledge base. If you have this problem, try my fix.",B08T6DZ81T,Worse Samsung's purchase I ever made,Size: 55 inches,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I have very mixed opinions about the Omni 43"", which I've only had for a few days now. I mainly chose this television for 2 reasons: 1) I wanted a smart TV, so I could watch OTA channels without switching inputs. And 2), I'm already invested in the Amazon ecosystem, so why wouldn't I go with a FireTV? That it's even an Amazon product has to be a plus, right?

Err, maybe. The Amazon payment option also figured into my decision. The TV arrived quickly in 3 days, although the Amazon delivery driver failed to read the warning on the box about not setting it on it's side. The setup was quick and easy, thanks to it already being registered to my Amazon account and downloading the apps I'd been using on my Fire Stick.

The picture quality leaves some to be desired, though. I'm neither an audiophile or videophile, but despite my attempts to tune the picture settings, it always looks a little cloudy and fuzzy. That's not to say that it's terrible, but it replaced one that's 10+ years older, and that cost nearly half the price, and yet I think the old one looks better. In fact, the 4K capability is about the only advantage the Omni has over my old television.

Speaking of which, the Omni version of Alexa allegedly does all these things that are not capable with a FireStick and a dumb TV. Off the top of my head, tuning the TV on/off with Alexa is one example. But I'd been doing that with a FireStick and dumb TV for several years. I can't explain it, but all these ""advantages"" already seemed available to me, with the exception of one or possibly two.

My echo dot had trouble hearing me when my dumb TV was on, so I had to yell to have it change channels or turn off the TV. This isn't a problem with the Omni and that's one of the best things about it. I've yet to use a camera with the Omni, but when I kid you not, when I asked it to display my Ring Doorbell, it said that ""cameras were not supported on this device"" or something akin to that. It later began working fine with my cameras, so I guess it just took a while to get things straight. Btw, my old dumb TV actually had a few advantages over the Omni, as well, adding to my mixed feelings here.

Finally, I want to talk about the included ""Fire Cube"", advanced Alexa implementation or whatever they call it. I was hoping to use it as a regular Echo device and move the Echo I already had into another room. The Alexa implementation was also mixed, though. It works quite well and does offer advantages over an Echo Dot, like how I previously mentioned it hearing me better with the TV turned on. But it's incomplete and more like the Alexa implementation in the FireStick remote, except that you don't have to push a button to speak to it.

For example, you can't put it in a group in the Alexa app and you can't use it in some routines. I'm still discovering the differences, but it doesn't appear that the Alexa in Omni is a viable replacement for an Echo device, which is a real shame. Furthermore, Alexa uses the same volume control as the TV, but one is always much louder. For example, if you're watching TV and ask Alexa something, you might not be able to hear her response. But if you turn up the volume to hear her, then the TV will blast your ears off. And this is just with the built-in TV speakers and normalization turned on to level the volume. There needs to be separate volumes or some sort of control for this, imo.

That's all I have for now, but I'll update this if I have anything else to add. Overall, I don't think the Omni is terrible, but it needs some work and just feels unfinished. Considering how Amazon uses Zoom to sell it, they should have included a $15 camera for free, considering the already high price for what you get.

Oh yeah, one more thing. I can't figure out any way to customize closed captioning for OTA channels. Caption customization works fine for everything else, so it's only the OTA channels. This isn't a problem for my other Smart TV, so I assume it's not a problem with OTA signals. And it's not a huge deal, but it's another example of something unfinished on the set.

I will end on a positive note, however. The reviews all say that the sound isn't very good. I happen to think it's decent for a TV in this price range. Some say that a sound bar is a requirement with this set, but I disagree. The sound is actually better than my other Smart TV and I love that it's has options for those who are hard of hearing (i.e. dialogue clarity). Ironically, one of the biggest disappointments for reviewers, has been one of the few things that I'm actually pleased with here. It's also super easy to just tell Alexa where you want the sound level.

Update: The Alexa implementation continues to impress me and I'm willing to admit that it's better than I originally thought. But it's still not a full replacement for an Echo device and it has a ways to go to get there. Right now you just can't use it in a smart home to do the things that an Echo device will do.

I've already had multiple updates and they've actually fixed some problems, but not others. And I'm still finding more, as well. This could be a great smart TV some day, but it was just released too soon and it feels too much like a beta version. Having said that, it still feels a need for me, so I'll be keeping it, while hoping to see improvements that shouldn't even be needed in a new TV. Amazon really needs to concentrate on getting hardware working right in the future.

Update II: Another disappointment: The menu navigation is surprisingly slow for a new TV. My Fire TV Stick 4K was much faster, despite being 2 years old and having little storage space left. Not to mention that it has half the memory of the Omni TV.

Update III: I have to give Amazon credit for regular updates. Most are probably for apps and the guide, but some have fixed existing problems already.

One glaring problem is the inability to choose a default profile for logging into the system, without removing profiles altogether. I have my mother on my account, so I can set everything up for her and because I want to be able to login to my profile from her TV. However, this means you need to choose a profile before Alexa will fulfill a Ring camera request, which defeats the purpose of Alexa making things easier. Surely this wouldn't be difficult to fix and it needs a fix real bad. Besides, who wants to choose a profile whenever it's unnecessary?

Update III: Seems that a recent update has made it possible to have your Ring camera alerts automatically display a live view on the Omni TV. This is why I chose this TV and I consider it a huge feature, since I don't live in the safest neighborhood. It doesn't seem to work with the original Ring Doorbell, however.

Unfortunately, recent updates have also made the sound worse. I often have to turn the volume way up to hear it now and the volume slider moves very slow.

Speaking of which, I've come to the conclusion that the biggest problem with this TV is that it sorely lacks the hardware sources it needs to function properly. The result is that menu navigation is slow and it often crashes. You'd think the opposite would be true for a television attempting to be more advanced, but nope.",B08T6DZ81T,Nice monitor cum tv.

"The first one arrived with a shattered screen (see the photo on this review) and the new one arrived w/o issue. I'll speak about the return issues later in this post, but as they do not affect the quality of this TV I will leave that for later.

The TV is heavier than I would have expected, and the first one that had the shattered screen felt very cheaply made. From the feel of the new one, the screen glass is part of the structural integrity of the entire TV, which seems like it would put too much stress on the glass to me, through the glass does appear to be laminated safety glass which does give it more strength, but it is still glass (I'm basing that on the pattern of the cracks from the first TV as some of them did not ""show"" on the surface and appeared to actually be ""under"" the top layer of glass).

The picture quality is really good and I have not noticed any weakness in the blacks as I read in other web sites reviews (at least not after I adjusted the colors, contrast and brightness). I have also used it for gaming and have not noticed any issues with the ""only"" 60Hz refresh rate (I mean TV's I grew up with were less than half that and I'm not sure the naked human eye can tell the difference between 60 and 120Hz).

The sound is really weak in the bass range, but the optical output works mostly (it does not work with Netflix for some reason) with my ILive sound bar (which the remote is able to control) to add bass back in it sounds ok. I didn't try other sound profiles, so maybe there are better ones.

Alexa integration work well (this my first Alexa product so I have nothing else to compare it too) except that it doesn't seem to know my TV has a sleep timer (it tells me it is not supported even though it's right there in the menu). Not sure if that is a software or hardware issue.

I agree with most of the 3rd party reviews I read, for the price you will be hard pressed to find a better price point, but it is more like an ""entry level"" piece of hardware for someone like me that this is my 1st 4K TV, and some video aficionados may find the feature set lacking, but so far everything I have used more than meets the needs of most people that just want a good TV for a good price.

-------------------------------Returns issues below not reflected in review above------------------
Now for the issues returning the broken one. Amazon only gave me 2 options, pay for it myself or have UPS pick it up. Well I was not willing to pay the return shipping as that would probably be as much or more than I paid for the TV. UPS pickup is problematic because I have a job and can't be around all day waiting for them to show up. I tried to call UPS and schedule or at least get an idea of when they would be there, but because I didn't have the tracking number they would could not help me. I ended up having to take a day off work so I could sit home on day 3 to make sure the TV was sent back.

Then Amazon didn't think I returned the item, so I ended up getting charged again for the TV. I went back and forth with Amazon on this multiple times and in the end, I ""guess"" they refunded my money, but what they did was refund the $205 is gift cards I used, credited my credit card for the price I paid for the TV and then charged me full price for the TV (which was only $10 more than the sale price when I bought it but still), so I ended up paying full price for a TV that was on sale and I was not able to use $205 in gift cards to help pay for it. I would not have paid full price for this TV and yet that is what I ended up having to do. I won't purchase any more ""big ticket"" items from Amazon, and will be limiting my purchases here in the future. It seems Amazon has decided to no longer care about the customer anymore. Time to find a better vendor to give my business to.",B08T6DZ81T,Nice and Smart,Size: 43-inch,3.0 out of 5 stars
"For the price the picture is amazing, I was stunned watching in HDR, fantastic.

The problem is the horrible software. There is a big lag when using the controls especially when making changes to the picture. Calling up the picture controls can mean waiting 15-30 seconds. You start to wonder if you pressed the button. Finally the controls appear and you try moving through them. There can be a lag there too, waiting to move down the list.

Want to change the brightness or any setting with a number value that goes to 100? You need to hope you are lucky and the tv isn't laggy again because holding down a button to decrease or increase a value can mean hearing 30 clicks on screen and seeing a value change by one number. To get it unstuck click down or up one at a time, it seems to unfreeze it, then you can go quickly again.

The bad lag problem is intermittent. Turn the tv on and everything works great, then it doesn't and you have to wait forever for it to make changes.

Alexa fails. She's working great, doing whatever you need. Then you ask her to do something and the tv flat out won't respond. Unplug the tv, plug it in and start again. I have had to do the three to four times a week. Happens so often I am using a smart plug so I do not have to go over to the set.

For the price the picture quality is a steal in my opinion. The tv is light and was easy to install and I am glad it can work with Alexa. the only reason I can accept the horrible software (I didn't mention all the problems) is because I bought the tv when it was on sale and the price was very low.

My next tv I want to be OLED and I am not planning on buying Amazon brand again. By the way, this is my second Amazon brand television and I had zero problems with the first one.",B08T6DZ81T,Great picture,Size: 50-inch,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I've had the TV a month now, so my review comes with many hours of usage & frustration.

(This review was updated 08/28/2022 and is at the end of this one)

I bought the 55"" Omni during Prime Day because it was a great deal on Amazon's new line of TV's...but have been very disappointed with the picture quality and lack of Alexa integration with Cox Cable's Contour box.

As others have reported, the picture quality has a hazy/halo-like appearance, instead of having a crisp & sharp quality and colors. Darkened scenes, such as night or not well lit scenes are so dark, that you can't see many things, details, or faces in the picture. I've spent umpteen hours resetting, adjusting, and fidgeting with the color & image controls with little improvement. It's simply a terrible quality screen & image.

I have a 12 year old LG 47"" flatscreen TV that still has a beautiful image & color quality, much better than this Omni. I bought the Omni to replace it, but have been very disappointed and annoyed by the image & color quality.

As for the Alexa voice integration and Alexa TV remote, they work great & are very convenient for Prime Video...but they don't work at all with Cox Cable's Contour cable box, which is upsetting for a brand new TV. The odd thing is that the TV and remote identify & recognize Cox Cable and the Contour box as a device hooked to it...but Alexa won't obey voice commands, such as, 'Change to channel 52'. And the Alexa remote buttons won't control channel changing, either, although I've paired the remote to the Contour box following the on-screen prompts, as well as re-doing the steps manually, according to Amazon's instructions and support website. The only thing that works is the Mute button. I've asked Amazon support about this and they have no answers, not even wanting to admit that Alexa & Contour devices won't talk to each other.

Basically, the TV recognizes the Contour box, but won't control it. I have a feeling that Amazon deliberately doesn't want to integrate with Contour for their own reasons, but won't admit it, and falsely represents Alexa's compatibility and then wastes customers' time trying to pretend that they don't know about this when customers try to get support to resolve it. All they do is point you back to the same support website for pairing devices to the TV that you've already tried...then blame Cox when they can't get rid of you, because you're mad at spending all this money on a TV where Alexa only half-works. Cox's Contour box has been around for awhile and there's no excuse for this lack of functionality.

In the end, I'm not happy or satisfied with this TV or Amazon and would not recommend it, unless you want something cheap to use in a guest room. I'm keeping the TV because I don't want to spend more money on another brand right now, but I won't be buying Amazon's Omni TV in the future, as I replace two other TV's in the home that are getting older.

REVIEW UPDATED 08/28/2022
To Amazon's credit, their customer service dept. called & emailed me after reading this review and worked with me to understand the issues, but had no resolutions, so they offered to replace the TV under warranty. I agreed, but opted to pay the difference and upgrade to the 65"" Omni Fire TV, which I ordered.

If you can spare the extra dollars, I strongly recommend purchasing the 65"" Omni. It is very superior to the 55"" Omni in terms of build & picture quality. Out of the box, the picture was phenomenal. The TV also has a thin, yet strong silver steel frame surrounding the edges of the TV, which make it very rigid & strong. Smaller Fire TV's don't have this steel frame, so they flex when lifting or moving them.

The 65"" Omni is a huge & heavy TV that requires a lot of room and likely two people to lift & place it, if you're a mere mortal and normal-sized human. I'm neither, so I was able to heft the TV by myself, from the ground to its new home on a stand several feet off the ground.

As for the Alexa vs Cox Contour cable box issue, that magically resolved itself one night on the 65"" TV, either due to an update or some fiddling I did in the Fire TV's settings...I don't know what the magic bullet was, but Alexa can now communicate with Contour and change cable channels by voice command.

On that note, I really enjoy using Alexa to voice-control the cable TV, Prime, volume, mute, etc. It's so much more convenient than using remotes. But Amazon has to be careful about this technology, it's future iterations, and how it's used in the home, because it treads a fine line between convenience and invasion of privacy. If I ever feel their devices go too far and violate my privacy, or that I can't trust Amazon, I'll never use or buy their TV's or devices again.

In the end, I'm very happy with this 65"" Omni and glad I upgraded from the 55"" Omni. I'm also very happy with Amazon's quick response to contact me about replacing the 55"" TV and not screwing around. If I could review their customer service separately, I would. But all I could do was call & email them to thank them for their good service to make me happy.

Although I would like to change my original 2-star review to a 5-star review, because of Amazon's outstanding customer service and how great the 65"" Fire TV is, I decided to leave it 2-stars, since the original review was for the 55"" TV, not the 65"". Amazon's system won't allow me to do a separate review of the 65"" TV I purchased...it keeps throwing me back to this review to update...so I'm stuck simply adding the updated info here.

Hope this helps people who are on the fence about Fire TV's and which size to get.",B08T6DZ81T,easy to use & switching between computer to tv,Size: 50-inch,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Pros:

Great big TV with 4 HDMI inputs - one dedicated for ARC for soundbars or speaker setups

Easy setup and customization

Fast connection speeds - i thought i had my ethernet cord in correctly but realized after three apps installed i saw that i didn’t plug it in. it was so fast with its wireless connection i didn’t realize it wasn’t wired.

Cons:

Remote pairing for cable boxes is a half days worth of searching for codes & ending up using auto search mashing a button for 20 minutes per input.

On the Fence:

Alexa - if you are all in on voice control this is the tv for you, i don’t use it personally so it’s nice that there is a physical switch on the bottom of the tv to turn that off - then you can run through the various alexa menus to turn that off or any privacy or ad serving settings - took me a half hour to undo all that, not sure the average person has the patience for that but hey maybe you can do it faster than me. This isn’t a con than more than a personal preference.

Tips:

Use the latest 4K HDMI cables you have, anything from the early 2.0 days will cause a fit in the HDMI ARC connection.

Get a stand, feet or wall mount this tv. The supplied feet are fine and work just okay but are a little low and makes remote use a bit hard if you have a sound bar.

Audio: For anyone else with an optimum cable tv box - for audio control make sure you go into the deeper audio settings of the audio settings and have it set to “other” for output control and not dolby digital - and then volume control set to variable. so wasn’t able to control volume of the tv with my cable tv remote until i put it on these settings. It took me two days to
figure this out myself - i’m putting this here to help anyone else out.",B08T6DZ81T,Great screen,Size: 50-inch,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I was able to get this on prime day lighting deal. The price was unbeatable to any 55inch 4k tv in the world. If I review this product based on the price I got this for it's going to be 5 stars for sure.

Considering the regular price my two cents as below,

I wouldn't buy this as my main TV for these reasons,

1. The VA panel - As expected this TV has disappointing viewing angles. The seating arrangement should right infant of the TV to get the best out of this TV.
2. Pre calibration - out of the box white balance is way off. This can be corrected but need some extra effort to get this done.
3. Dolby vision is not included in the 55 inch which effects the 4k resolution.
4. Comparing the larger versions of the same TV - The 55 inch has less premium black plastic finish

Why I absolutely buy this as a second TV to bedroom or guest room.

1. Light weight and it was just so easy to mount on the wall.
2. Excellent contrast ratio, resulting in deep blacks in a dark room.
3. Decent reflection handling. The semi-gloss finish reduces the intensity of direct reflections.
4. 4k content is displayed perfectly, with no sub-pixel dithering.
5. Very little stutter when watching movies
6. Fantastic low input lag - Specially in the Game picture mode.
7. As an existing fire TV user it was super easy to set up the TV. All settings from my fire stick can be exported with no issues.

Over all there are similar quality TVs in the market for the same price range, but with this TV consumers get a hands free experience specially if you are in amazon eco system with an unbeatable smart features with fire TV capabilities.",B08T6DZ81T,Awesome smart monitor,Size: 43-inch,5.0 out of 5 stars
"We ordered this 75"" TV and are very pleased with our purchase. There were some reviews saying the TV is slow but we have not had that experience.
Our favorite thing about this TV is that you can tell the TV to change from hdmi 1 to antenna. Once on the antenna, you can then tell the TV to change from channel 2 to 8. It even comes with Pluto TV channels built in. I don't even have to go to the app they are included in the digital channels on the antenna.
The picture is so clear and glare is nit an issue for us anymore unlike our previous TV which seemed to have more glare on the screen.
We did do a direct ethernet connection to our modem so I cannot speak to how fast this TV is on wifi but if you can. I recommend using the ethernet port built into TV because our TV is very fast and responsive. I do not normally take the time to write a review but I just had to tell other people considering buying a smart TV our experience so you can feel better about buying this TV over some of the other smart tvs out there.
One other thing to keep in mind is if you are a prime member you get access to prime TV so between prime video, Pluto and our subscription to discovery plus app we were able to completely cut out cable or satellite and now exclusively stream our entertainment which saves us over $100 a month. So if you have any interest in streaming TV and movies on demand this is a great TV to consider.",B08T6DZ81T,Great Smart TV for Bedroom,Size: 55 inches,1.0 out of 5 stars
"This unit replace a 55"" LG that was constantly having problems with Wi-Fi connectivity. This Fire TV redressed that as the Wi-Fi reception is great with no buffering issues whatsoever. While I can't speak to the picture quality being I'm blind, my wife said it's a step up from the LG in terms of resolution and clarity. What I really like about this TV is the Voice View screen reader capability, which enables me to access and select menu options. The speech synthesizer is decent but pronounces ""resume"" as ""revoo,"" which threw me off a bit. I still applaud Amazon for including the capability and at least considering the needs of people with disabilities, which other manufacturers don't seem to do. The hands-free control is great and I like that I'm able to use voice commands with the remote, which again has far reaching benefits for folks with disabilities who may have neuropathy and/or carpel tunnel of the fingers and hands. Alexa integration is flawless, which I'd expect from Amazon being they manufactured the TV and created both the Fire and Alexa platforms. So why not five stars, you ask?

There's no need to have to enter a pin every time you want to change a basic system setting for the TV when all you want to do is set a pin for Prime Video purchases. We have two young children, and little hands have been known to grab the remote and accidentally purchase a video or two. But if you want to set a Prime Video pin to prevent said purchases, the pin also needs to be entered for such things as changing screen resolution, changing accessibility features, and other tasks that don't have anything to do with blocking purchases. Seems this is an opportunity for Amazon to enhance user experience so the pin can be more localized to the specific task as opposed to it being a global pin to complete all tasks.

All in all, it's a fine product and it's only going to get better as the technology continues to evolve. The twenty-four month no-intrest installment plan is also great as many more folks like me with competing expenses and limited budgets will be more inclined to go with a Fire TV instead of having to shell out several hundred to more than a thousand bucks at one shot. I wish there were an option to give half stars as I give this device four and a half stars. Amazon's world domination will continue because they seem to really know what customers want while centralizing and streamlining all their content.

"When I saw this 55"" TV on Prime Day sale for $299, hands-free with Alexa, and with no-interest payments over 24 months, I just jumped on it. I've spent almost that much over time replacing lost remotes! I didn't realize how big this TV is, so I almost cancelled the order...but I'm glad I didn't. I've got it sitting on one of those sturdier metal and plastic folding tables (like a card table but rectangular), and I've plugged my Mac Mini into one of the HDMI ports so I can also use it as a computer monitor. What a difference! I can have all kinds of things I need at any given time open and placed around on the screen (see photo), and because I work in my recliner that's a good distance from the TV, I can read everything very well and get to all my open windows super-fast. Then, at night, when I'm ready to watch TV, I can sit back on the daybed that's on the opposite wall and watch it all on the big screen.

My 2014 LG soundbar works with it, but it's only got the optical port cable and cannot be controlled with Alexa. One of the Fire TV tech guys very patiently told me what I need to get if I want to upgrade my sound setup, and I went on and ordered one of the Echo Dots on sale for 19.99 because I couldn't find the one I bought before. I'll probably get a new soundbar at some point but, for now, I can certainly watch TV and listen to music using the one I have. But right now, I have to have the remote to control things that Alexa cannot control, and I keep it in a remote wrangler tied to my daybed (where I also sleep). I thought at first that the TV was just turning itself on by itself in the middle of the night, but then I realized that either I or one of my dogs was flopping over onto the remote, turning it on. That's a temporary issue because once I have an Alexa-compatible sound system set up for it, I can hang the remote on the wall and forget about it.

I've read a number of reviews of the Fire Omni TV series, and they are shown to be on the lower end, picture-wise. If I had wanted a super-duper knock-your-socks-off viewing experience for MSNBC, which is what I watch more than anything else on the TV, I would have to have spent five times as much, and why would anyone do that? Well, if you're really into the primo video experience and have the bucks, I guess you might...but this TV is perfect for me. The #1 selling point for me, other than the rock-bottom sale price, is the fact that I can control pretty much everything with my voice.

I did knock off a star for one reason and one reason only: In the Inputs setup, you can specify what type of product you have on a particular HDMI port. Soundbar, gaming console, etc., but there is no selection for ""Computer."" I want to be able to say ""Alexa, open my computer."" Now I have to say ""Alexa, open H D M I 1."" Cumbersome.

"I wouldn't have bought this at full price after reading the reviews, but I got a good prime day sale so I went for it. The quality of the image is good, with a few pretty important downsides. The contrast and darker parts of the image are pretty good, however, I feel like it could be a bit clearer without having to crank up the sharpness. After some tweaks that I found online, the picture quality is optimal. HOWEVER, a major issue of this TV is the response time --it's pretty awful. For a 4k smart tv branded under Amazon, I would expect something better. Compared to the old smart tv that I've had for several years, the response time is pretty bad. You press a button on the remote and it takes several seconds for it to respond. The image options are a bit convoluted but I got the hang of it pretty quick. A bonus for me was the Alexa integration. It's pretty cool to walk into your room and say ""Alexa, TV on"" and it powers on. At its current price point of ~$520, I'd probably hold off on this and look for something else, maybe a better well-known brand on sale. As I said before, I got this for an amazing price during the prime day, and for what I paid, its worth it, but when its not on sale, skip it.",B08T6DZ81T,Samsung has horrible customer service!,Size: 50-inch,3.0 out of 5 stars

"There is nothing to dislike about this television; great picture and I haven't needed to hook up the soundbar.

Another good feature is you can see the screen even from a pretty extreme angle.
This TV has so many features that I can't begin to enumerate (mainly because I haven't used them yet), but one feature that I don't think was mentioned is the description; included in the package is an infrared cable that enables the tv to transmit to gaming console through glass, so you don't have to leave doors open if your console is behind glass doors.

"25.July.2022 : I've had the TV actually plugged in and in-use for about a week. I use it mostly as a monitor for my spare PC or when my kid is using the bigger screen. I'll try to review per feature/function I've actually used :

Alexa : the Alexa integration is REALLY good. I have a mix of Google Home and Alexa throughout my house and I mostly lean Google because historically it responds better... The Alexa technology on this TV is actually responding so well that I've moved a couple of devices over to it (if you have LG Thinq products, this TV interacts REALLY well with those). It's very quick to respond and never misunderstands me. Definitely a major step up from other Alexa technology I've used.

FIRE TV: it's what you'd expect from Amazon (sadly) - all your apps and such like any other smart TV with a LOT of product and service pushing that you can't disable. I don't want to be advertised to on a TV I already paid for. Save the ads for your website. There is more space dedicated to advertising services you don't have than there is to apps you downloaded. All-in-all, even tho they limit the shortcut space for your downloaded apps to one short row (and use the other 20+ rows to advertise to you), the apps do actually run smoothly and I haven't had any errors or issues yet.

Picture/sound : the long and short of it is that the picture quality and sound are FANTASTIC. Even my PC games look great on this TV and that's saying something.

User Interface/hardware? : here's my one gripe... I have my PC set to HDMI 4. When the TV or the PC go into sleep mode, the TV seems to ""forget"" that the HDMI is connected. I'll turn the screen on and I'll wake the PC and it'll say ""HDMI 4"" but the screen will be blank (as opposed to ""no signal""). Just blank. I have to tell Alexa to switch to HDMI 1 and then issue a command to switch BACK to HDMI 4 and the picture will appear. I don't know why this happens and I've tried different sleep settings on either device, but the only way to avoid it is to keep both devices turned on all the time and that's just begging to burn them both out early. So, as it is currently, you have to navigate away from whatever input you're wanting to use and then back to it for it to work as intended. Maybe my TV is just glitchy or broken, I don't know, but that's been my experience.

"This FireTv Omni series replaced a 12-year-old Sony Bravia 40inch TV which was top of the line at the time. So all my comparisons are based on that swap.

First, the things which were noticeably better.
- Going from an HD TV to a 4K TV made a huge difference. The picture is clear. The colors are bright. Way more dynamic contrast.
- The thing weighs almost nothing compared to my old Bravia which had a full metal bezel around the whole frame. It was like lifting up a sheet of glass to hang the Omni.
- The smart TV features are nice to be integrated into the TV rather than having to use a separate Firestick.
- The WiFi is way faster. But I suppose the fact that no one uses a 12-year-old modem anymore should be an indicator of how antiquated that tech was in the old Sony.

Second, the things which are pretty much the same.
- The LED baklight is not really any different. Light and dark spots are noticeable. Nothing is pure black since it's just an LED backlit display.
- The sound routes through my sound system just fine and sounds pretty much the same. Basses and trebles are about what they were before the swap.
- Has pretty much the same number of ports for input/output. (Minus antique RCA ports which no one uses anymore.)

Third, the things which are worse than my old Bravia.
- The motion quality of this TV is not as good. It pixelates and has artifacts when fast objects move across slow objects. Shows me that the Bravia processing is superior. But for the price, this isn't terrible. But it is definitely noticeable and sometimes annoying.
- The control interface is not as flexible as my old Bravia. I can't seem to tell the TV to control my soundbar like I could with my old Sony through the ARC HDMI. Seems like something that should be pretty much standardized.
- Alexa is annoying. I turned off the voice detection so that it doesn't randomly interrupt video or audio.
- The power cord is too short if you have to plug it in to a normal outlet rather than one behind the TV. Mine barely reaches, but I can't hide it with the rest of my cords since it's off to the side and can't run down the center of the wall.
- The VESA spacing is really low. This only matters if you're swapping this TV for an old one and not changing mounts. But it is annoying, nonetheless, that I couldn't set the Omni as low as my old Sony was.

So if you don't expect 120+ frames a second for motion smoothing and don't expect a major sound improvement, this Omni is a great tv for a budget price!",B08T6DZ81T,Excellent color and resolution,Size: 50-inch,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I have this TV in my home gym and bought it for live television. I had bad issues with SlingTV from the start. The app didn't load properly, had to be restarted, and then video playback was horrible. I did find the Fire TV GUI a bit slow on this television, so I assumed the processor was just too weak and I gave it a scathing review. I spoke with customer support and then did additional testing with Prime Video, and I even streamed a 4K video to it over my home network. Everything played back flawlessly. I feel bad for the initial bad review, seeing as how it was actually the SlingTV app. I'm used to this app on a Fire TV Stick and Roku Ultra, so I thought it would function properly on the Fire TV. I was wrong!

This television has a good picture and acceptable sound for its price range (what TV really has great sound from the small speakers?). I still find the user interface a little slow, but updates and reboots did help. Again, this is a good TV for its price range. I think it is quite an exceptional deal when Amazon occasionally slashes the price.",B08T6DZ81T,Works grest,Size: 50-inch,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I just want to say first, I got this TV for $110 during a flash sale and for that price this TV is absolutely fantastic.

Otherwise though, it's a decent TV for the price. Picture quality is decent overall, and I like the remote. I personally love the integration with alexa which while not really necessary is a nice to have.

The software is what I don't love. The fireTV software is so much more responsive than any rokuTV i've used when just moving around or typing. However the actual software itself is not my favorite. I've used quite a few different smart TV OS's and this is the worst in terms of things just being unintuitive and having things in weird places, though this is remedied partially by the fact that you can just tell alexa to start or download your app.

So as a whole I don't love fireTV OS, but other than that this is a nice TV and alexa makes up for some of the inconveniences of the software.",B08T6DZ81T,Came home and it was on its face all smashed up...,Size: 43-inch,5.0 out of 5 stars

As I went through the set up and went to settings, add equipment, the tv will only recognize ATT, Directv and another! After talking with tech support they said I had to purchase the Fire Cube in order for it to work with my cable company. With no luck the cube does nothing to change Alexa controlling the Xfinity cable box!! The tech support for Amazon nor Xfinity had no clue as to what I should do! Now do I return the tv and see if the next one will recognize Xfinity? I spent 2 days and hours on the phone trying to figure out how to get Alexa to work through Xfinity!

"I bought this tv as a birthday gift for my wife....and she loves it! I love it too! We actually have our tv's mounted side-by-side in our room (because we game together). I have a 55"" Samsung QLED, and she used to have a 42"" LCD Vizio up there next to mine. Of course that tv compared to mine was a huge difference. But once we put this Amazon Fire 50"" Omni up there.....I was blown away!!!! My QLED costed me around $1200 a few years ago. This Omni, which is considered a ''budget tv'' and the picture quality is not far behind! (in my opinion).
You can also talk to Alexa w/o having to talk into a stupid remote! lol.
But as for any 'negative' (so to speak), if you're really into specs and you're looking for a tv that runs at 120hz, or has dolby surround sound, then this tv isn't for you.

"I constantly have issues with the software making me regret buying a smart TV. My complaints
- It frequently hangs requiring me to pull the power out to reset it.
- Apps get stuck forcing me to clear the cache or force stop them.
- It's often slow to respond to the remote or Alexa commands
- Alexa itself stops listening every now and then. I'm forced to press the Alexa button on the remote to wake it up.
- Can't always use Alexa for screen prompts in apps, for example, skip intro in Netflix or HBO.
- Can't issue an Alexa command and use the remote at the same time.

It also annoys me to have Disney and Hulu buttons etc on the remote control. Completely. waste for me if I don't have them and wverytime I look at the remote it annoys me.

"All I have owned is a Samsung, but my last 65-inch from them only lasted 3 years right when the warranty expired! Since I had a fire stick and that is all I use for TV watching along with a ton of apps I thought I would give this a try because everything is built in including Alexa. What I like is Alexa works even when the TV is off. Unplugged my other Alexa and only use the one on the TV now in my bedroom, for lights and ceiling fan. The picture is crisp, clear, and has more memory for the apps. I shopped around for weeks, and this is the best price for a 65-inch 4k I have come across with the features it has.

"This TV is decent at best. The sound and picture quality are okay, nothing extremely special. The alexa integration is fine when it works. i never really use this because it takes a few seconds to recognize my voice and realizes i’m saying something to it. I find myself repeating myself when using the Alexa voice commands so i don’t really bother anymore. Another big thing about this TV is that the apps do not close when you hit the home button, you have to manually close out of the app for it to stop. For example if you’re watching a YouTube video and you click the home button, the youtube application will still be running in the background until you click it again and it will resume. you might think this is useful but due to this, the TV gets laggy and unresponsive like scrolling through the tiles gets laggy or turning up the volume takes a few seconds to register. in my opinion, the unresponsiveness and lag from the tv is a dealbreaker.",B08T6DZ81T,65 tcl 5 series 65s555,Size: 65Style: TV Only,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Alexa integration?? Why can't I connect to my Echos as externsl speakers? This is ridiculous. I want to pipe the game through the house. I can't tell it to connect to ""Everywhere."" I can only connect via bluetooth, and ONLY ONE SPEAKER AT A TIME.
The only ""Alexa integration"" is you can use other Alexa devices as a remote control. But it has its own microphone so they don't actually do anything. IT IS NOT INTEGRATED WITH ANYTHING BUT ITSELF.
Another BAD audio problem: if I connect to my amplifier with an output cable, I can't use the TV speakers. So if I want to use the TV speakers, I have to PHYSICALLY UNPLUG the output cable from the TV. Why can't I just say ""Alexa, use internal speakers?"" GoogleTVs can use multiple Nest speakers AND remain connected to Google Home. Didn't Amazon invent this stuff?
In fact, I'd have to say ""Echo, use internal speakers,"" because it has a more sensitive microphone. I can be in the next room and say to a nearby Dot, ""Alexa, weather,"" and the FireTV switches from the last 45 seconds of the game to the weather app, I get yelled at, and I don't even get the weather report from the Echo Dot.

"I got a really great deal on the 65 inch omni series during prime days. I got it for our bedroom so I didn't really care how great the picture quality was. I was pleasantly surprised though! It's not as good as the Sony in the living room but live TV even sports it does very well. Anything you stream in 4k or 1080 looks outstanding. Seems to have a pretty fast processor. Using tivimate or kodi whatever you want to watch loads really fast, much faster than the 4k fire stick on the Sony. The Alexa feature works well for searching or even saying hey fire up a sleep timer for 30 minutes. All in all it's a great buy and have no real issues with it. Tweak the picture settings to your liking and you'll enjoy it. I have all the picture aids off like smoothing and everything. The sound is also impressive for just TV speakers.

My only complaint is the ups man who was acting shifty on giving me my tv said no one was home the first time when he tried to leave it and said he left a slip my mom watched him look at her and drive off then he tried to do the same thing with my husband the next day it didn't work cuz my husband stopped his truck and then he looked sad when he had to unload it so I don't know if he was just being lazy or trying to steal it by saying it got lost on its way back to amazon since ups only tries to deliver twice before sending it back. So make sure someone's home watching for it cuz some ppl r dishonest. It comes in a fire tv marked box so there's no guessing what's in it. Altogether I love the tv so far packaging removal wasn't a Hassel, set up is normal if you already have smart devices in your home like I do then setting up is even easier since you can link it to your other amazon devices. Plus 300 for a 4k 55 inch is a really good price. It took me 15 minutes max for set up probably closer to ten. The rest of the ppl on here complaining need to realize you got a 300 dollar 55 inch tv. It's not Samsung, or Sony, or a high end LG it is Amazon's first attempt at a television it's not perfect and it's going to need twerking. You didn't spend 1000 on a large tv u got a cheap 55 inch and as such I do give it five stars because price is on point, you can control the device using your voice without a remote, image is good, it's very responsive and not slow on load so you get what you pay for if you want to complain about little things get a more expensive tv.",B08T6DZ81T,Some Pros and Cons.,Size: 55Style: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars

Channels dedicated to single shows that show episode after episode. Nothing you would normally seek out but a lot of things I used to watch before getting rid of cable. So many options. I feel like I haven’t even cracked the surface of the amount of entertainment at my fingertips. Now I just have to remind myself that I still need to go to sleep and stop app surfing.

"I love almost everything about this TV/Monitor. It looks good, it has a good picture and good sound. It is easily configurable, has a good variety of apps, and works well with WiFi.

I use this device as a monitor for my computer. It replaced an LG without built-in sound and no TV capabilities. It is connected to a PWAY HDMI USB Switch, with two computers connected.

The only problem I have with this device is that it is TOO sensitive to the signal from my computer. The LG monitor would sleep/standby as expected, but this monitor WILL NOT. It will enter a standby mode (blank screen) for about 15 seconds, and then it will wake up again. At which point, it immediately begins the standby/sleep process and then goes dark. About 15 seconds later, it wakes up and begins the process all over again. Even with the computers disconnected, this happens.

The only way to make this monitor go into standby mode (didn't have this problem with the LG) is to disconnect the HDMI cable. Powering off the computer, standby, or hibernating the computer doesn't work - remember, there's an HDMI switch involved here.

2) OS COMPATIBILITY - Samsung needs to get together with major US cable companies and get Samsung_OS the be 100% compatible with the cable providers. One problem I consistently have with this model, is that when you first turn-on the TV, the TVOS scans invariably goes to another device (i.e., ROKU). At that time, the cable-provider controller is useless, so you have to actually use Samsung's controller so you are able to go desired HDMI input.

3) AUDIO - Another problem is the AUDIO. Don't care whether you have Series 6, 7 or 9 processor - it doesn't make any difference.

"Background: We purchased the 65-inch S535 model about a month ago but weren't very satisfied with it. We saw the new S555 model released recently and the price is the same, so we decided to give the new model a try.

Here're the pros and cons of the S555 model compared to the S535 model:
+ (2~3 seconds) faster response time in terms of opening apps and loading movies.
+ The brightness of the S555 model is better than the S535 model (prbably the same as the S546 model. The power rating tag of S555 is 275W compared to S535's 190W).
+ The S555 model has much better picture quality as you can see in the attached photos (S555 on the shelf, S535 on the floor. In case someone is curious about it, the shelf is IKEA's KALLAX which fits the 65 inch TV perfectly). We set the picture settings of both TVs to the same, and the S535 TV's color is obviously uneven and yellowish.
- The S555 model's number of contrast zones for local dimming is half that of the S535 model.
- The frame and stand of the S555 model is worse than the S535 model (painted iron-like frame vs. textured steel frame; plastic stand vs. metal stand).

Additional comments:
I have a feeling that TCL North America is trying to hide the tech specifications in the NA market, which makes it hard to compare different models before you purchase. However, TCL does provide detailed tech specifications in the Chinese market. Also, here's a fun quote from TCL China: ""To put it simply, with dozens of contrast zones, the overall picture quality can barely improved. For 100+ contrast zones, the overall picture can be significantly improved. For 300+ contrast zones, the overall picture quality is comparable to the OLED"". It's a shame to see that TCL North America is gradually reducing the number of contrast zones for the 5-series.",B0B7ZXM1B8,Best TV picture I've ever seen !,Size: 50-inch,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I use this as a monitor for a Geochron world calendar, and it looks great. I don't use any of the streaming stuff. The TCL operating system allows me to set a default HDMI input port and that's all I care about. The picture seems bright and clear. Putting LED bias backlighting on the back makes the picture pop even more. The Geochron display changes slowly so I don't care that it has only a 60Hz refresh rate. The frame appearance is low-key and doesn't call attention to itself. There is a night light on the front; a very small lamp that remains lit when the TV is off, but it can be disabled. The power plug is on one side of the TV and the rest of the connections are on the other side. VESA bolt holes worked fine for wall mounting. The feet seem a little flimsy. The remote wastes space on dedicated buttons for streaming services I will never ever use. Do I wish it had more contrast zones? Sure, why not.

"Replaced my 65"" OLED B7a from 2017 with a 77"" C2 and I've been running it for a week as of now. The picture quality after calibration has improved over the older model. I feel the black levels on this device are far far better than the B7a ever were, which BTW required a lot of ""tinkering"" to get to what the C2 did pretty much out of the box. My old OLED had no burn-in that I could see, even after 5 years of daily usage, but the older OLED panel was never as uniform in solid colors test as this panel is, not even when the B7a was new. Especially watching dark scenes now, there is no fixed pattern noise anymore.

The scene motion on this TV is better what the B7a has, which was already good, but it had issues with some stuttering under certain conditions. Obviously this TV is 120hz with a 5 year newer video processing unit, so it would be expected to be a good improvement.

The worst part for me during initial setup was figuring out the new WebOS UI. Coming from the older B7a WebOS, which had things in different places and required different steps to get things done was quite frustrating at first. I guess once you understand how it works its okay.

After setting the TV like I wanted, I then updated the firmware and after the firmware update things didn't work right, things like LG channels got stuck, couldn't click out of some popups, etc, so I had to perform a factory reset, and redo the whole setup again. The TV has been running well since. So be aware that if you perform a hardware reset, chances are you might have to do a factory reset and redo all the settings.

The remote internal accelerometer wasn't calibrated somehow when I first paired it, so the pointer kept always pulling to the left on the screen. To resolve this I had to shake the remote several times until it finally became accurate. The scroll wheel feels a bit too deep this time compared to the previous magic remote from the B7a, which was way too high... guess the next TV will be at the sweet spot! :)

IMO. For the price of this TV I would've liked some backlight on the remote too. I did miss not having a pause button on the remote like the B7a. Which was nice to pause shows without having to bring the menu and click on the pause screen button.

Connectivity for DLNA worked well, the NAS and other storage stuff in my LAN was detected fine after everything was setup correctly.

Mobile screen cast via Miracast, etc... worked well with all my phones/tablets that are capable of screen cast.

All the basic streaming services I've tried worked well too.

Audio from the default speakers is certainly okay for a TV, and it seems to have improved the spatial audio somehow over the older B7a. Still no match for a dedicated receiver/speakers setup, but if you don't have one, this TV alone will be a good start.

Privacy was and is still a concern for me with this TV. And let me say it loud and clear: Serving ads on a 2500 dollar TV feels quite a bit of an insult, TBF; b/c at that point why not just give the TV away for free? if you are going to soak the end user in ads, and sell their usage stats, etc at some good $$$?
I believe most of the tracking, etc can be disabled by going into the agreements and disabling all the options there. For most of the basic B7a level of functionality that I wanted I only had to agree with the two first terms, so voice and all other terms are not enabled, which still is a bit of a concern to trust if a company will honor a checkbox... Also, the remote seems to have a built-in microphone, so if you are super concerned about this thing eavesdropping then you can just take the batteries out of the remote, or use an universal remote but you lose the nice mouse-like pointer. The old B7a remote doesn't seem to offer full functionality with the C2, at least not the mouse pointer part.

Overall the TV was a step up from the B7a, both in size and picture quality. Only time will tell how the TV pans out in the end, but if the B7a was an indication, working well for 5 years, I think this TV should last at least the same amount of time.",B09RMFZZPX,So far so good,Size: 50-inch,4.0 out of 5 stars
"First week impression: visually stunning with some annoying quirks as a computer monitor.

I purchased this to replace an aging Seiki SM40UNP. I use it exclusively as a computer monitor, both for work and gaming. Visually the LG is in a different league than the Seiki. Colors are more vivid, it's much brighter, and blacks are like a portal to the endless void. These differences were apparent before enabling HDR, and then HDR bumped up the colors and brightness even further. During HDR calibration I flinched and cursed to an empty room when it switched from black to white; it was blinding. For gaming this is good stuff. I played some games with native HDR and some games with Windows Auto HDR. I ended up disabling Auto HDR because I thought it made some games look over-saturated, but that's probably just personal preference. Native HDR looks great.

The same visual fidelity that's great for games is a little overwhelming when using the monitor as a workstation, particularly when reading black text on a white background. Even after cranking the SDR brightness in Windows down to its lowest level, I can feel eye strain starting after just an hour of reading text. Some people have suggested that this has more to do with Windows' HDR implementation than the monitor itself; I don't know. Whatever the cause, I prefer the drab presentation of the Seiki monitor for reading/editing text. I'm typing this review on an old LCD monitor because it's more comfortable than doing it on the LG.

OLED protection features are also a bit annoying at times. E.g. if the TV detects that the input it's showing is mostly unchanging, it will slowly dim the screen. Unfortunately, typing into a dark-themed text editor seems to count as ""mostly unchanging"". Every 10 minutes or so I need to grab a bright window and shake it to wake the monitor from its apparent stupor. It's like trying to keep a tired puppy awake. I disabled other features like logo dimming that seemed to be causing problems, so this whole-screen dimming is the only one that continues to irk me. I also voluntarily use a black wallpaper and configure the Windows taskbar to auto-hide to protect the panel from burn-in; make sure you know what you're getting into if you're going OLED for the first time.

The most significant weakness of this TV is that it is... well, a TV. It's a bad sign when you have to use a remote control to agree to a privacy policy before using a computer monitor. It's not plug-and-play, it's plug-and-read-reddit-thread-and-modify-dozens-of-settings-and-play. After spending a couple hours researching and fiddling with settings there are still some things I'm not happy with. For instance, the TV doesn't enter standby the way purpose-built computer monitors do. When the computer stops sending a signal the TV takes over and shows vibrant wallpapers for a while before turning off completely, such that you have to turn on the TV again separately from waking up the computer. Maybe there's a setting to change this - if there is, I may never find it.

The final quirk is a graininess most noticeable in uniform blocks of grayish colors, which unfortunately feature prominently in many dark-themed applications. It appears to be caused by slight variation in pixel color. The grain is visible at a viewing distance of 24 inches / 60 cm, but IMO it's only distracting if you're closer than 18 inches / 45 cm.",B09RMFZZPX,Order was fulfilled perfectly. Very happy.

"This 77” LG C2 OLED TV is absolutely breathtaking. This is the best picture quality I’ve personally ever seen and it actually exceeded my expectations. Of course you get stunning contrast, colors, and crisp 4K scenes, but I want to call out some lesser mentioned features that I’ve already come to love.

- Magic remote: the Nintendo WII style cursor that allows you to navigate all apps either through traditional remote buttons or via the aim and click method is great - providing a new way of doing things but allowing you to still use traditional buttons. Also allows for equipment control to control my Samsung sound bar.
- WebOS: unlike my older LG tv, now all my streaming apps are native to tv. I get to ditch the Fire tv cube for paramount plus and HBO max
- Alexa integration works nicely
- Game mode, presets like FPS, RPG etc make switching for each game super easy. Already this tv has given an upper edge in FPS games.
- Sound- for some reason all sound is crisper
- Airplay: iOS screen mirroring and airplay work great, as well as screen mirroring from my MacBook Pro. I didn’t realize this was a feature.

Only downside so far is the Picture in Picture / split screen not working (seen other reviewers having same experience). It would be great to be able to play a game and have Netflix in a PIP window. Hopefully future software updates will fix this.",B09RMFZZPX,Love it!,Size: 43-inch,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Where to start? Beautiful picture 4k and SD, outstanding sound, well thought out design. It's all that and more. However, a diagram of the inputs and outputs would be REAL handy, especially when trying to plug things in, And just what do you do with the little plastic pieces (finally found in the one page instruction sheet). And the same goes for the, what I assume to be, IR blasters? Since it is set up for the PC that gloriously melted down when I attached it to the monitor (I should point out that the Alienware died while the Pi 4 8GB and little NUC never had a problem with it), I can not say how it looks for gaming and will be moving it and taking photos of the port connections and label them in the photo for future reference. I also found it to be a royal pain to find anything on LG's website. I still haven't registered it because my model does not exist yet. I hate time paradoxes! Okay, fine let's look for any manuals. Oh. I see. searching support gives an article Google Stadia issues, and another that tries to sell me one. Not holding out hopes for any support, at least for a while. It really makes me wonder if the fire sale pricing is a way to get rid of stock...

In short, don't buy unless you are techy, geeky, or know someone who is, and treat then we because they will be your support for this beautiful monitor. I know I am ripping on it, but as I said earlier, it has a beautiful picture, outstanding sound, well thought out design (if they only documented it better).

"#1 son installed the TV following the directions provided, connecting the cable and Blu-ray player was simple. One remote included. Cable remotes can turn set on or off but can’t move through the menu, need the Lg remote for that and signing into apps.

I would love to tell you that this tv is great. It looks awesome at the Best Buy that i saw it at. But I will continue to have to wait to get my hands on this tv. Their attempt to deliver this tv failed on epic proportions. My wife and I were here waiting all day for this tv. I left my phone in the bedroom while I took a quick shower. They called my phone while I was in the shower and did not bother to knock on the door. They said no one was home and rescheduled the delivery. I called the number back 4 minutes after they called; for them to tell me there was no way to get a hold of the driver and I would have to reschedule. The delivery truck comes from somewhere in Houston TX and I live in college station tx which about 2-2.5 hours depending on traffic. They were in my drive way and because I didn’t answer my phone they are going to reschedule a delivery that it over a hundred miles away simply because they did not knock on the door.

"Coming from a Acer Predator 34 inch curved monitor, the size increase of this monitor isn't a shock. The width is similar, but there is more vertical height for sure. I will say that for a monitor sitting on a desk, 42 inches is about the limit for me. Any larger and you are turning your head too much.

I also recommend a monitor arm so you can move this around easily. So often in the past I have done without it and once you get an arm, you wont want to deal with something sitting on your desk. Especially a 42 inch monitor or tv.

It's a great OLED display with plenty of brightness. It supports G-Sync / FreeSync and variable refresh rate (VRR) @ 120hz. It has inky blacks as all good OLED screens do. The auto white balance is not too annoying for PC use in my opinion.

Since its a 4k screen, I do organize windows in all 4 corners of the display for work and I am sure that we will see a small amount of image retention eventually. Time will tell. I haven't turned off any of the self protecting features of the TV and don't plan to. Nothing annoying to report as a result. There is also a pixel cleaning feature that runs as needed already if this works similar to C1 models.

It really is one of the best displays I have ever used both in terms of color, black levels, response time, and clarity.

"8/14/22 update: LG got the parts out fairly quickly and a local electronics company did the repair in less than an hour. They replaced the screen, not a board.

I reiterate that the TV itself is a 5 — it’s got a fantastic picture and I have 30+ years of broadcast TV production experience so I know what I’m talking about.

But I’m only updating my rating to 4/5 instead of 5/5 because of LG’s service process.

When I opened the original repair ticket, LG automatically provided troubleshooting recommendations. I had already followed the instructions that are available online and told them so. However, there’s no ability to attach a picture to the ticket and they automatically close the original ticket and then ask you to open a new ticket with all of the same information that was provided previously in case troubleshooting doesn’t fix the problem.

Once the second ticket was entered LG eventually asked for a picture but then they didn’t make it available to the repair facility so they asked for a picture as well.

Start to finish, time to repair completion was about a week and the TV was not completely down during this time. But I think LG’s repair ticket workflow needs some tweaks

Would have rated this 5 stars as it's a fantastic TV but yesterday a thin line developed top to bottom about 1/3 of the way in from the right edge.

"This is my second LG and third led flat screen. The screen here is incredibly thin (at least at the top) and the whole unit was much lighter than my previous 65 inch. That made it easy to mount by myself. The picture is beautiful and because I have shades on all the windows of my TV room the brightness is more than adequate (knew OLEDs can have a brightness problem but this model--and the next higher--have been reviewed as quite good in the brightness area.) Because I had an LG previously, I am quite familiar with the controls and the options although the OS in much updated from my previous unit, but that is part of why I bought new. Now I can do any and all streaming directly from the TV without needing to go through my cable service and/or a Fire cube as I was doing. It is also very convenient that the TV controls the on/off of the new AV receiver I also just bought (down to only two remotes!). The only difficulty I had in getting everything setup was to get the lip sync correct which ended up requiring that I bypass any corrections from both the TV and Receiver.

"This 70-inch Samsung Tv so far (a few days) meets may expectations regarding its picture and (somehow) its sound quality. I spent considerable time on adjusting tv settings to meet my expectations and I have achieved my goal, for you can control/adjust basically all aspects of the Tv picture, motion, sound, etc. However, this TV remote/pilot is quite annoying. It has minimum options to control, and it is difficult to use in a dark room (its buttons are not lit). Also, the Tv software/program annoyingly wants you to go on the internet and purchase/join some networks/providers.

A problem with the so called ""pink screen"" developed. Basically, from time to time, when my TV was turned on it displayed just a pink screen with no picture nor any sound. I contacted a Samsung support which is overseas, of course. They made a record of my TV issue and accepted my photo of its pink screen. They said, it was due to the weak or disrupted/corrupted video signal, HDMI connection between the source and TV. However, upon plugin it in and out and in again, apparently, my HDMI cable was not causing this problem. After researching the internet I decided to call my Spectrum cable provider. To my surprise, the technician was quite familiar with this issue, and remotely tuned my cable box (HDR). Upon his tuning, my TV screen turned to have WAY better picture quality (!) and he promised me that the pink screen will never show on my screen again. So, now I have a way better picture, practically ideal quality. Also, I keep my fingers crossed that this pink screen will never pay me a visit. Also, I wonder, why this TV was not packed at its factory with a decent manual brochure clearly explaining all these issues to the clients.",B09TQ4ZV6P,Perfect size,Size: 50-Inch,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought this TV to become the centerpiece above my fireplace in my large Great Room.
Turns out that this Samsung is perfect in every way. Not one complaint.
You can stand one foot from the screen and see not one pixel. Yet relax in the couch 20 feet away and still a perfect picture with rich, vibrant colors. It's also quite smart, acting more like a PC with tons of options to adjust, control and see virtually anything streaming, on my spectrum cable, or online via the web. Takes a bit of a learning curve working with this unit in order to get a full handle on everything this TV can do, but well worth the effort. This TV will not disappoint.",B09TQ4ZV6P,Great quality for the price,Size: 50-Inch,5.0 out of 5 stars
"We've had this TV for about 1 month now and so far it's a pretty good TV. The images are sharp and vibrant, sound quality is what you'd expect of TV speakers- clear enough, gets loud enough.

One complaint on this is that some of the smart features are not excellent.

For example, on the remote, there are several buttons to open up Netflix/Prime/Disney+ etc. but there's no way to change where those buttons lead. So for someone like me, who uses Hulu more often than anything else, the only other direct option is to use the microphone, which frequently misunderstands me- as most voice activated things do. I also wish I could use the voice commands to go directly to one show (ie ""open X FIles on Hulu"" vs. ""Open Hulu""...*Opens Hulu*... *type in name of show/scroll*)

We even connected it to our Google Home, but even still, the voice commands are limited in what they can do and it's usually just faster to do it manually.

Still though, I really can't complain. it's pretty decent overall and once I start playing my shows, it's usually smooth sailing.",B09TQ4ZV6P,Very good for the price,Size: 50-Inch,4.0 out of 5 stars
My husband loves the TV. If your a gamer at all the refresh rate is great and so is the picture and graphics. Also as a TV it's pretty great too the ONLY problem I have with ANY Samsung Smart TV is it doesn't seem to like to loaf Netflix (both my bedroom TV and Game Room TV) other than that it's great.,B09TQ4ZV6P,Disappointed with Picture Quality,Size: 50-Inch,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Excellent tv. It arrived really fast. WOW!!! Best picture, it is so LIVE! Set up was easy&fast. FYI I don't have cable service, just internet. The remote, I confess, takes a bit to get used to, but in two days I was good using it. And I already know that, It will take a while discovering new features and no matter how much I find out, I'll barely be scratching the surface of what one can get from this tv! Gee, there are so many features to explore. I can't get over it.
To stream all my movies I have an array of free movie sites and a ton of other sites one can subscribe to. I can also download any site if not already in the enormous list of movie channels. Samsung offers ""News Channels"" to keep you updated with the world daily news.
But you can always download TubiTv-for free movies and free ""Live News""-- it wasn't in the ""apps home list"", but I downloaded it. As well as I downloaded the ""BritBox"" I subscribe to. WOW! Watching ""Shetland"", ""Vera""or ""Midsomer Murders"" etc... on this tv is like have yourself going for a walk in the movie set of those British countryside scene. It's soooo live, the image pops out of the screen at you.
I can also go to the internet browser, (after connecting a keyboard to this tv) and shop, research, write emails or do my fiction book writing and save it all to my email ""drafts"" file.
Ah, you can also connect your phone to the tv and answer it when ringing if you use a wireless pair of ear pod (a Bluetooth I paid only $23+tx online, have owned it and gifted several throughout the last 3yrs), just as I use with my computer, no tv noise from lowd music or movies to the neighbors! I don't know what else can I ask for, we'll, I am still discovering new functions in this incredible tv! I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS TV!
So happy I got it, and for a senior like me on a low SS pension, the 5pmts installments from Amazon suit my budget perfectly, in fact, it made all possible to buy this tv and other things for my new housing studio apt I recently moved to! That's why I always come back to Amazon for all my purchase needs!

"Woke up this morning at 7am and saw that package was sitting outside my front door in Florida, within one day of order placement. Amazing Amazon. Opened up the package, hooked up the HDMI from my Dell desktop PC and DVD Player within minutes. Started up the setup procedure. The Samsung 43""Q60B picked up my network, the PC, all my Samsung TV Plus settings from my 75""Q80A in the living room; the DVD Player; as well as my Samsung account settings automatically as it showed up in the main menu listing. It's as if this TV read my mind. Need I say more folks?

Excellent picture quality out of the box as well as the sound. For the PC, I set the picture to Warm2. Desktop will show up automatically every time I turn the TV on. Other settings remain the same as in my 75"". This highly intuitive TV is appropriate for this day and age, but perhaps not for everyone. And thank you Amazon for the 5-installment payment method.

"The picture quality is phenomenal. I got this because it was the cheapest 2022 Samsung model I could find that could run the XBOX app (cloud gamining without using a physical xbox).
A hardcore gamer who plays competeitve first person shooters might want to go for a higher model...like the Q80B, because that has VRR and 120Hz). But for people who are just playing Final Fantasy, Assassin's Creed, and Minecraft this is just fine, because the difference are minimal to non competitive gamers. It would costs hundreds more for a smaller size of the higher level models.
The sound quality is good and I don't feel inclinded to get a soundbar. It's lightweight and thin, so I was able to set it up myself as a petite woman. It was easy to navigate the menus and setup everything. It auto detected all gaming devices I plugged into the HDMI ports and added the icons to the gaming center section. Customer service responds within seconds on the samsung site for any questions. My only complaint was the annoying bloatware Samsung TV app that auoplayed random TV episdodes everytime I turned the TV on. Easy fix, long press on it and select ""disable"". Oh, and the remote charges by solar energy (either your ceiling lights or sunlight!). I found the viewing experience so pleasant, that I re-watched some movies I already saw in the past, just to see them in upgraded graphics.

"I’ve purchased several Samsung TV’s and I am very disappointed with this purchase.

I’ve had my TV 3 weeks and I’m returning.

Out of the box, the picture looked good, but had issues connecting my Apple TV 4K.

In short, I’ve replaced the Apple TV for a new one, replaced 3 HDMI cables and tried various ports.

Sometimes my Apple TV works, sometimes the image blinks on and off and sometimes the picture if full of static.

The remote sucks too.

UPDATE:

I had decided to return this TV. The night before my scheduled return I reset the TV. Once I completed the reset everything worked perfectly.

I cancelled my return and I’m very happy with my purchase. I’ve gotten used the the remote. It isn’t that bad.

"My family and friends have had TCL brand Roku TVs and I've always liked the quality of them. This television (TCL Google TV Model 43S446) came up for sale for around $180 during Amazon's Prime Days, so I thought I'd give it a shot even though it's the Google TV software model instead of the Roku TV software.

The Good:
The television was packaged well for good protection during shipment, it was easy to setup, and had good picture and sound quality. It does have a composite (aka: RCA or yellow/red/white) cable input which is nice for hooking up older devices. It is in the form of a 3.5mm jack though, so you'll need an adapter (not included). It has a good antenna TV programming guide (internet connection required), I personally prefer the Roku TV antenna TV programming guide, but this one is still very good.

The Ok:
The Google TV software is easy enough to use, but is much more cluttered than a Roku TV interface. If you prefer a simple, clean looking, easy to use interface, then a Roku TV is a better way to go. As I said, the Google TV software is still easy enough to navigate, and no problem at all for those with sufficient tech experience. Customers in older generations with less tech experience may need more time to get sufficiently acquainted with the menus.

The Bad:
Those familiar with TCL Roku TVs may be fond of the live TV pause feature, which allows you to rewind and/or pause live TV. This feature works very well on Roku TVs. This TCL Google TV has a similar feature, but in my opinion it is too much of a hassle to use. First, you can't simply rewind live TV like you could on a Roku TV, you have to actually pause it first for it to begin recording and to be able to rewind (unlike Roku TVs). So, if you miss something and want to rewind back a few seconds to see it again, you're out of luck. As for the pausing live TV part, the remote itself has no play/pause, fast forward, or rewind buttons. In order to pause live TV you have to go through a settings-like menu, which in my opinion takes far to long to do when you want to quickly pause a show. So, if one of the reasons you want this TV is for the live TV pause feature, don't get it; go with a Roku TV model instead. I considered returning it, because an easy to use live TV pause feature was something I really wanted, but I decided to keep it since it was such a good deal on sale. However....
After about a month of owning the TV, it started to have problems. One morning it wouldn't respond to trying to change the inputs, but that started working again eventually. The same morning, the TV tuner in it seemed to fail. None of the TV (antenna) channels would come in, every channel said ""No Signal"". I confirmed it wasn't an antenna issue or a coax issue. After turning the TV off, unplugging it for a minute, and plugging it back in it seemed to work again. So it may have been a Google TV software issue rather than the actual TV tuner hardware, but I didn't have a way of confirming that. However, TV tuners have been around since essentially the invention of television. Even the newer digital TV tuners have been around since, at least, the late 2000's. Since the technology is well established, that should be one of the last things you have issues with. So, for me, that was the straw that broke the camels back. I didn't want to take the chance of having more issues in the future, so I decided to return it since it was within the return window.",B09JVS5295,Pictures perfect like your right there.,Size: 50 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars

I saw this Sony X90K and the picture between it and the Samsung were miles apart. I went home and ordered it on Amazon and had it in ONE DAY! I am soooo glad I went to look at the TV's in a store. The picture quality on this 65"" Sony is just fabulous. It is just as good as advertised if not better.

"I have dreaded ""Smart"" TVs for the last several years but this TV has changed my mind. Everything works so smoothly and nearly out-of-the-box. I use an HDMI cable to my Denon receiver for the ARC audio only and the only change I had to make was to disable Dolby Digital Plus under the TV audio settings. Without any inputting of manufacturer codes or selecting my receiver model or any of that nonsense, the TV remote fully controls the Denon receiver volume and power. One touch of the power button on the remote turns on/off both the TV and the receiver.

The picture color is stunning. I did see a very slight gray clouding in the lower left-center of the TV when during the TV setup wizard and I was concerned. But when watching actual media, the local dimming technology removes all clouding. The dark scenes are great, and the colors and brightness are amazing.",B09R9RTQ92,Hisense is my new favorite brand of TV!,Size: 43-InchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars

"I just got this TV installed a few days ago. It replaces an older Sony Bravia 55"" TV. Three comments at this time.
1. The remote is no where near as functional as the previous TV remote. Sony needs to do a much better job here.
2. The picture is just plain awesome (and several modes to choose from). I prefer Vivid.
3. For some reason, the sound (several options to choose from) seems much clearer (and louder) then the previous TV! Bravo! LOL

"I have wanted another Sony Bravia for awhile since I really liked the first one I had. The picture quality is amazingly clear, and I love the Home Screen. I am able to continue watching shows within apps right from the Home Screen and pick up where i left off. The Google Assistant is also very handy, and contrary to what others may believe, you don’t need to have an android phone to have your phone cast to the screen. I have an iPhone and it screencasts super easy with no quality loss.

The TV is pretty gigantic so be prepared to lift the thing to get it onto a tv stand. I’d suggest having a second person help you get it onto a stand so you don’t accidentally damage the screen.

"i was very heartbroken after i set up the 55"" tv. it randomly restarted. i loved the picture and the fact that it had a nextgen atsc 3.0 tuner. unfortunately even tho cincinnati channels 5, 9,12, 19 and 64 are broadcasting in 4k i could only get a 1080p picture. sometimes the higher def signals didnt come in at all but i still got the 1080i or 720p atsc 1.0 signal. so my disappointment is that the atsc 3.0 signal is supposedly supposed to be stronger than the atsc 1.0, but that wasnt my experience. but thats not the tv's fault. my main issue was that it restarted constantly. the longest i could go without restarting was about 30 minutes. that was very disappointing.

the other issue was the remote control. with older sony tvs i could get to what i wanted by looking at the remote. here, because there are fewer buttons you have to dig thru the tv menus. id rather scan my remote than look thru menus. the other feature that i didnt like was google tv. id prefer the old sony android set up that did not utilize google tv. it seemed more simpler than google tv trying to push all these streaming services on you.

since i ordered the tv and amazon had it (i did not want one thru one of the 3rd part vendors) the return was very simple. my advice is, if it is available thru amazon avoid the hassle of dealing with a 3rd party vendor and get it thru amazon. so eventually i did get a 48"" sony (xbr-48a9s) that just happened to have android only and was 120hz (but for a ps5 that 120hz feature wasnt available - pretty ironic). i was sad that it didnt have an atsc 3.0 tuner but i figure i can always buy a set top box with the tuner later. but i love my 48"" and so far it has never randomly restarted.

i was going to have amazon replace the 55"" but then i read another review mentioning the same exact problem of it constantly restarting. so i am happy and disappointed with sony at the same time.",B09R9RTQ92,"No cable plug, no manual, not control",Size: 55-InchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars

Sony was absolutely no help so we returned to Amazon before wasting $900 dollars. Good luck if you buy Sony X80K.

I must add after writing this review and having already sent the tv back to Amazon Sony did contact me and offered to swap it out. We have since reordered the X90K 65” we originally wanted. We have an X90K 75” and it is great! Hopefully the X90K 65 will be also.

"HISENSE PROMO FRAUD UPDATE:

So I received a return shipping label for my TV return. However, the attached email states that the label is for a laptop return for a laptop purchased at Costco. I am returning a TV not a laptop. Also, I purchased the TV from Amazon not Costco. I am afraid to use the label since the email has the wrong purchase details. I am even more worried that Hisense is attempting to get out of its obligation, regarding the promotion and my return. I will now have to call customer service again on Monday, as they don't accept calls on the weekend. This will be the second time I have had to call, and it takes a long time to get through the automated phone response system. My advice - if you purchased a Hisense TV from Amazon under this so-called promotion, you have 30 days to return it to Amazon. After that, you are stuck with dealing with Hisense. Therefore, if you think you are not happy with the purchase, you should return it to Amazon within the 30 day return period and thereby avoid having to deal with Hisense.
WARNING: HISENSE PROMOTION FRAUD - I purchased this TV under the 100-Day Hisense Promotion. ""Try it for 100 days and return it if you don't love the TV"" Well I decided to return it because it has numerous problems, including audio problems, turning off by itself, etc. The return was approved by Hisense. I received a confirmation email stating that a return shipping label would be emailed to me within 5 business days. However, it has been five business days and I received no label. I called Hisense customer support and was told they are ""having a problem "" with their return shipping labels. I was told to wait another five days for a label, and if I haven't received a label by then, to call customer service. I don't know how they can have a ""problem"" that prevents them from issuing return shipping labels. I fully expect that I will not receive a label - again - and I will have to call back and they will have another excuse as to why they haven't provided me with a label. The time limit for returning the TV once the return is approved is 30 days. Can't very well return it with no return shipping label. I can foresee them using delay tactics until the time limit expires, and then they will refuse the return because it's outside the time limit. I should have known that this promotion was too good to be true. I have changed my review to 1 Star because of this issue.
UPDATE #2: I called HISENSE customer support about the return shipping label. They say the shipping label I received from them is the correct label and to call UPS to schedule a FREE pick up. The label is for UPS Ground service. However, UPS refuses to pick up the package. They insist that I must pay a $30 fee and I must have a UPS account so they can bill me for the pick up. Hisense insists that the pick up should be free. So here I am, caught in the middle. I have no way to get the TV to a UPS location. To say that I am upset and disappointed with this experience is an understatement. Hisense advertised the promotion as having easy returns, but it is anything but easy. Not sure what will happen next but I will have to call Hisense AGAIN (this will be the third time) to try and get this straightened out. I fear that I am going to be stuck with the TV (which has several issues). I may call Amazon, or file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, to see if they will accept a return. What a major headache and nightmare. I will never buy a Hisense product again, especially under a Hisense promotion.
TV Review: I received my brand new Hisense 65-inch U6H Model 65U6H HDTV today. This was sold and shipped by Amazon. The TV ships in it's original retail box, so no extra packaging to provide added protection during shipping. My U6H arrived with some damage to the outer box. The corner top of one side was damaged, and there was a puncture in the middle front of the box - right in the middle of where the TV screen would be. There was no obvious damage to the TV. Setup of the TV was quite easy. The legs fit perfectly into the base of the TV and each leg only requires two screws to secure to the TV. The screws went in easily and without issue. I was actually able to do the whole setup process myself, and I am a short 56 year old man. The TV is surprisingly light and I was able to lift it relatively easily by grasping it with one hand on the bottom beneath the screen and one hand to balance it on top. I was very impressed with how easy it was to get the TV out of the box. Just cut the three plastic straps, open the box, remove the styrofoam insert, an the outer box just slips right up and off. I was also impressed with the inner packaging. In particular, there were protective plastic shields on the sides of the TV, as well as plastic material all around the frame of TV which strips off easily. So as far as packaging, and the ease of physically setting up the TV, I would give it an A+.
I had no trouble plugging in the power cable to the back of the TV and turning it on. Immediately, the TV started the setup process, which I found to be easy and quick versus other TVs I have owned. I was easily able to connect to my WiFi, and tested out several different apps including Netflix, Amazon Prime, and YouTube. Everything happened quickly and smoothly - better than any TV I have used before. There were no glitches with lip sync while viewing content through apps - a problem I had previously with a Hisense TV. Overall, I would give the smart features another A+. Now, we get to the meat of it all - how does the TV perform.
My first immediate reaction was wow. I immediately tested the picture quality by watching an 8K Dolby Digital video on YouTube, and I found the colors to be super vivid and bright. In fact, I think the backlight was a little too much, as white colors came out totally indistinctly. However, I was easily able to adjust the backlight and picture settings using the remote. By the way, the remote seems to work very well - there is virtually no lag between pressing a button on the remote and seeing the TV respond.
Now is where we get into some problems. Yes, the colors are vivid, out of the box. As far as brightness is concerned, I found it exceptional. In fact, I had to dial back the brightness a bit. Mind you, I watch TV at night in a semi-darkened room. However, if there is an area where Hisense excels, it is in the brightness of it's panels. The U6H is no exception. Despite it's advertised relatively low peak brightness, something like 600 nits, I believe it is plenty bright enough for a large majority of consumers. Yes, you could go with a U8H or last years UHG, and get much greater brightness and backlighting. You also would pay considerably more. But in my opinion, the U6H will more than satisfy the majority of users when it comes to just peak brightness. If only brightness were the only issue.
Sadly - and I wanted to like this TV so much - there were problems right out of the box. First, the Hisense webpage for this TV advertises that it supports HDMI 2.1 on all of its HDMI ports. That is not true. I can confirm that it only supports 2.0. Period. If you are a gamer, this is a problem for you, as it is for me. And if you are a gamer, you know why. If you are not a gamer, you can skip the rest of this review, until the conclusion.
I bought this TV knowing that it is a 60 hertz panel. So I was prepared for that. I have my PC hooked up to this new U6H, using Windows 10, with an NVIDIA 3060ti graphics card. I am using a high quality, high speed HDMI cable, so my problems aren't the HDMI cable. The problem is, that this TV will not accept full 4K - in HDR - from a PC. It has a limited color gamut. It will not process 4.4.4 Chroma in 12-Bit or 10-Bit color at 60 Hz. In fact, it is limited to 4.2.0 Chroma at 60Hz in 8-bit color.
It will process RGB color from the PC - but again, only in 8-bit color. In short, you will not get more than 8-bit color from this TV when hooked up to a PC. This is depressing. I just sold a 2020 Vizio V-Series TV that I bought new for $250 on clearance, and it supported HDMI 2.1, as well as 4.4.4 Chroma
or RGB at 60 Hz, 12-bit color. Which leaves me asking myself, why did I buy this TV? It doesn't do what it is advertised to do - it doesn't process HDMI 2.1. It doesn't process more than 8-bit color when connected to a PC - like my old Vizio did - and to top it all off, the TV shut itself off within 1 hour of turning it on. This is exactly one of the problems that I had with the U8G - for which I was unable to get warranty support - they just wouldn't respond to my support requests. I finally had to return the TV because the return period was about to expire and nobody from Hisense had responded to my complaints. So...where does all of this leave us?
Should you buy a Hisense TV or not, and if so, should you go with the U6H? Well, I bought this 65 inch U6H after having a bad experience with the U8G that I had purchased - a bad experience with the TV and a bad experience with customer support. The thing is, I really want Hisense to succeed in it's mission - to bring high quality TVs to the public at a reasonable price. But I will say that I bought the U6H during a Hisense promotion - I have 100 days to try the TV and return it if I am not happy. So, I decided to give them one more chance to get it right. Right now, I'm not feeling very good about my purchase. I just wanted a TV that I wouldn't have problems with - I don't want to have to go through the whole warranty process, or the Amazon return process. But now it looks like I will have to go through it all again. In conclusion, there is something to be said for going with a more well-known brand like Sony, Samsung, or LG. You pay a little bit more at the outset, but in my experience it is worth the extra cost when it comes to overall quality and customer support. Another issue I would like to address is updates. I want my TV to update automatically. And I expect a new update to bring improvement, not make things worse. This is an area where Hisense lags. The last Hisense I bought, the U8G, had audio problems, and Hisense has yet to come out with an update to solve the issue, even though this is a problem going back a year or more. MY CONCLUSION: Hisense makes super bright panels. If brightness is your priority above all else, then yes, you will be happy with a Hisense U6H. But there is so much more that goes into buying a TV. For most people, buying a new TV is a major expense. Like me, they don't want to have to return a TV or try to get support from customer service for a TV that should just work as advertised, out of the box. Unfortunately, quality control and customer support are areas where Hisense fails miserably. I understand that some TVs come off of the assembly line with defects. What matters is, does the company stand behind it's product? In regard to Hisense, in my experience the answer is no. They do not stand behind their products. Accessing customer service for support or warranty service is difficult, and they do not respond to requests for help. This means that many people will be forced to return their Hisense TVs because they cannot get support before the return period runs out. Exactly what happened to me with the U8G. In closing, I would say this - buying a TV is like buying a car. You should buy the best you can afford at the time. The prices for Hisense TVs seem like a bargain - on paper. But I believe, based on my experience, that you will get what you pay for, and in the end the chances are pretty high that you will have problems with a new Hisense TV, and when you try to get help from the company, they will blow you off. You will then be stuck with a TV that doesn't do what it's advertised to do, from a company that doesn't stand behind it's products, wondering as I do - why did I sell my 2020 Vizio TV. UPDATE: So I was able to get the TV to accept Chroma 4.4.4 color from my PC by adjusting the settings in the NVIDIA control panel. However, I had to lower the refresh rate to 30Hz to get it to do it, and the color depth is still stuck at 8-bit color and ""Limited"" dynamic range. When I change the refresh rate to it's native 60Hz, the only color format available is Chroma 4.2.0 with ""Limited"" dynamic range. So no matter what you do, the TV only outputs the minimal 8-Bit color depth. I can also select RGB color format, which then allows for full dynamic range, but only if I change the refresh rate to 30Hz. So in summary, if you want the TV to run at it's native 60Hz, you are limited to Chroma 4.2.0 with 8-Bit color and limited dynamic range. To run RGB you will have to lower resolution to 30 HZ, and you will get full dynamic range but still only 8-Bit color. Or, you can run Chroma 4.4.4 at 30 Hz with limited dynamic range.
UPDATE: So a little while in, and I have some important updates regarding the 65-inch U6H that I purchased. First, there was a firmware update from Hisense which pushed through automatically. That was an improvement over the U8G that I had owned previously, so way to go Hisense. Also, the update seemed to do some good, as the TV is more stable, i.e. not turning off by itself so often. However, now the TV will not connect to my 5GHz WiFi - it connects for a moment and then disconnects. I'm forced to use 2.4GHz WiFi. It seems to work fine on 2.4 though. Also, this TV has trouble dealing with my Vizio M-Series soundbar. When I turn on the soundbar, the TV shuts off occasionally. At this point, I have to say that although the picture quality is pretty good, I would not pay full price for it, which right now is $598. It's just too glitchy. I paid $549, and if I keep it Hisense will give me $100. So for $449...yes I'd say it's worth it. But not $598.",B09YVVQQN5,Came broken box was on perfect condition,Size: 42 inchStyle: TV Only,4.0 out of 5 stars
"UPDATE 11/02/22: I have since been invited to join Amazon's Vine programme. Rest assured, though, that I will always provide frank and updated feedback on all my reviews. This Hisense was actually bought by me, and my opinion is still that it's a gem.

First, let me preamble this review by saying a previous review of my 43” Hisense was the top review when I wrote it 5 years ago. That’s because I continually updated that review, and I intend on doing the same for this one, so please check back.

I give modern technology about 4 to 5 years (or, depending on price, 5-6) before I replace it for something better. That was the case with my old television, a Hisense which I bought for the Olympics that year. It was the first time I had ever heard of that brand, and honestly, I was wary. I’m not a fan of Chinese goods, since they’re built for affordability, not reliability. To my surprise, my old Hisense is as good as ever, and now a relative has inherited it, as the colours and 4K technology still hold up pretty well.

Nevertheless, I had been tempted by Amazon’s new affordable FireTV television. I pulled the trigger for their 55” Omni series, but almost immediately returned it. If you’ve never owned a 4K TV, that’s a good starter set. But the washed out colours and lack of features (no full array dimming, Quantum Dot, and HLG) made the return inevitable. So for 120 dollars more, I chose the 55” UH6 Hisense, which had tempted me with its instalment plans and dazzling features.

The second I turned on this Hisense, I knew it was a home run. POP POP POP. The hue! The brilliance of the whites! The deepest blacks! That’s what I had dreamt of all along, and I got it.

It has taken me a long time getting the settings just right. My old settings weren’t working as you can imagine, since the U6H offers so much more depth that one doesn’t need to yank up the contrast or brightness to get a good picture. In case this is of some help to you, here they are:

Picture
Backlight

Local Dimming High
Backlight Level 100
Automatic Sensor OFF

Picture Mode “Dolby Vision IQ”

CONTRAST 50
BRIGHTNESS 44
COLOR 55
TINT 0
SHARPNESS 10

Advanced Settings

Color Temperature LOW
Motion Enhancement OFF
Motion Clearness OFF
Noise Reduction HIGH
Digital Noise Reduction HIGH
HDMI Dynamic Range AUTO
Active Contrast HIGH
Color Space NATIVE
Low Blue Light OFF

I bought some 8K certified HDMI 2.1 cables for around 22 dollars (less on promotion), to be able to use it in the 2.1 slot to get the best audio and video. Just make sure that they are labelled “certified” for 2.1. Since it’s relatively new technology, the reviews can’t be more than 2 years old.

I also bought the new FireTV Cube, 2nd generation, to be able to get the most out of my new Hisense. It was half off during Prime Day, and I couldn’t have made a better co-purchase. The promotional addon 99 cent channels have really made it zing to its full potential. If you really want to enjoy your new set, though, you need to get one of the big boys: they have the most Dolby Atmos movies and series.

Having mentioned Dolby Atmos, here’s the only real negative about the Hisense. Its native speakers are excellent, but if you want the full Dolby Atmos experience, that immersive feeling you get in a theatre, you’ll need to buy a soundbar which decodes Dolby Atmos. That can run you from 400 to 900 dollars, new. My still very decent 5.1 Vizio soundbar doesn’t have Atmos, but it’s Dolby Digital Plus sound is brilliant all the same. It took me forever to figure out that you have to untick the CEC functionality, or else eARC will take over, and send the audio signals to my non-Atmos soundbar. If you want Atmos without a soundbar, you’ll have to make do with “TV Speakers”, until you buy one. To check it, head over to a major streaming service. If you see the precious double logo (Dolby Vision and Atmos), you hit the nail on the head. I suggest using the movie “Okja”, or “Black Panther” as your test movies for sound. The Atmos sound will blow you away.

DETAIL: If you don’t have a soundbar which decodes Dolby Atmos, you’ll need to use the Hisense’s own TV Speakers. Go to “Settings”, then, “Channels and Inputs”, then “Inputs”. Deselect ‘HDMI control’. You will now hear movies in Dolby Atmos. Otherwise, it’ll be decoded as Dolby Digital+.

I uploaded some photos for you to see the full range of colours you’ll get with the U6H. Check out a YouTube channels featuring animals. The wildlife videos are a joy to behold with your new set. The DETAIL. Incredible.

I’ll be adding to this review, as mentioned above, when I find anything which might help those considering buying it. Even one week in, I can tell you this is a no-brainer: buy it.

A similar set by Samsung with all the bells-and-whistles the Hisense U6H has would run you a cool thousand!",B09YVVQQN5,Line of dead pixels after one hour of use.,Size: 55 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I wasn't sure how I'd like this Google TV, as I've generally leaned toward Amazon's Alexa.  I was intrigued by the features and price, so decided try it.  All I can say is WOW. 

Packaging was great - opened it up, and legs are right in the Styrofoam top padding, so you can't miss them!  Got help pulling it out of the box.  Couple screws to attach the legs, and it was ready to set up!  Will eventually mount on the wall, but wanted to make sure I liked it better than the Vizio I'm replacing.  Based on what I've seen the last few days, it'll get mounted this week! 

I wasn't sure what to expect for a ""Google Smart TV"".  I was absolutely surprised how easy this was to set up.  After powering it up, it walks you through step by step.  You connect it to your Google Home app (which I had to install).  It allows you to update settings on TV using your phone, or even use it as a remote.  Nice features and handy to have! It took longer to get set up compared to a Roku or Amazon device, but overall was smoother and more ""complete"". The other apps have you up and running quicker, but then you need to go into settings and add the apps. There's still some of that with this, but it covers the major subscription apps in bulk, so overall it saves time over the other systems. Like many other SmartTV's, logging into services can be done via phone or password.

What really impressed me was the Google TV features. I enabled Google access to the TV itself as prompted during the setup and trained it, speaking various sentences as prompted. Now I can say ""Hey Google, power on"", and the TV powers on.  Other commands work as well = ""Open Netflix"", or ""Play Survivor on Paramount"".  Of course volume control works too!  I really like that this is built into the TV - no need to use the remote or hold buttons.  I did find this seems to go to sleep, but I'm sure it's a setting to keep it active at all times.

As for TV itself, I love it!  Colors are vivid, bright, and clear.  There are plenty of HDMI ports, and they're clearly labeled.  Setup features for the TV itself are very easy to navigate. Loved the default picture, though in a darkened room was just a tad too bright.  Adjusting the picture is crazy simple - between the included 'modes', and the custom controls that can be applied to each, you can easily adjust for any lighting condition.  I'm impressed with the QLED display!

Sound quality also impressed me for this price point model. I've had to get sound bars for other TV's due to 'tinny' sound, but this has clear sound, and it's more than adequate for our room.

Overall, I'm really pleased with this 55"" Smart TV!  Easy setup, fantastic picture, great features and sound, and all at a great price. I can highly recommend!",B09YVVQQN5,Don't believe the BS you read....,Size: 48 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"this product is great for the price. I wished it was cheaper tho! haha. but let me tell you my experience about it. first of all the packaging was ok. it was easy to install. you need to screw two metal stands to the TV. the stands looks stable and firm. then you have to plug it in and that's it. it was easy and anyone can do it. specially it is light weight and can be handled by one person. during the setup you have to connect to wifi. the wifi search and finding it was really fast and easy. and then few steps to connect your gmail account to the TV and finally if you have accounts on Netflix Hulu and other channels you will enter your creditionals and it will be finalized. these steps are also really easy and fast. now it's time to go and see how is the screen quality. the screen is 4k and with this budget is one of the best options available. it uses quantum dot technology which helps you have wider range of colors. the Variable refresh rate has been improved and this option would be more pleasant if you are a person like me who plays video games a lot to be more smooth. the contrast ratio in this TV is one of my facorite aspects which is pretty great. this TV has a great quality in watching movies and shows. it can well handle reflections if you have a home which gets lots of light during the day like me. but keep in mind you cannot put the TV in front of a window that has direct light and expect this TV doesnt show the reflections!!! it can handle well lit room. next thing that might be important is sometimes you want to watch a movie from your collection and it has low quality like 480p. I tried it and surprisingly it upscaled it very well. the quality of 720 and 1080 upscaling is great which I expect every 4k TV do that but upscaling 480p is not easy I believe and I loved how it does. the borders are 1 cm and I consider it thin and I like as it is and the overall thickness is also around 8cm which I believe it is great for this price.
the last thing that I forgot to tell is the quality of remote control, the buttons are really smooth and soft. it works from distance and it responds to your commands really fast. overall I liked it. maybe if I want to mention its disadvantage with this price would be I would expect them to add HDMI 2.1 compared to U6G so the refresh rate could increase more but still its not noticeable. again with the money you are paying you cant expect it includes everything.",B09YVVQQN5,Remote control eats batteries,Size: 65 inchStyle: TV Only,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I am extremely satisfied and happy with this TV so far. Personally, think that its one of the best TVs for the price range.
1. Modern TVs have built in OS- this one is Google TV, which I like. The controller has a google assist button which is useful, but to be completely honest, I find myself using my apple TV most of the time (apple has been locked up in their “walled garden” lol). Nevertheless, have been impressed with Google TV: the apps that I use were in the app store, easy to use, responsive.
2. Picture quality- was expecting to picture quality to be lacking, but so far, picture quality has been superb. I use my TV to watch movies and shows, I don’t have a video game system connected to the TV so I can’t comment on how the picture looks while playing video games.
3. Sound quality- the previous television I owned, had poor sound quality, to the point I almost bought a sound bar. This TV- the sound quality has been superb. I have a small living room, but regardless of where I am in the living room, I could hear the sounds perfectly (sound is loud and rich).
4. Remote control- simple to use, not many bells and whistles. I primarily use my phone to control my TV, which is an option with this TV.
5. Packing- a saw a review that complained about the packing, I was worried too, but the TV arrived with no damage. The box I received was well padded and in great shape by the time I received it. It was delivered by a Prime truck, not sure if that makes a difference.

In summary- great TV for the price, awesome picture quality, great sound, ok remote control.",B09YVVQQN5,Buy this TV if you’re on the fence!,Size: 65 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
" I bought the U6H 75 inch TV in late September, 2022. I am writing this review about 3 weeks later. I am very pleased with the purchase overall. I use the TV to watch movies, sports and TV shows. I am not a gamer, and I am not a TV tech expert. I bought the Hisense S214 soundbar to go with the TV, and I bought a ethernet to USB port adapter to use a wired port from my router to maximize speed. I plug it into the USD port and get about 300 megabits per second speed (the TV has USB 2.0 ports). I watch the TV with Theater Night mode with Motion Smoothing turned off.

For 4k (HDR) movies, it looks outstanding. The first movie I tested with is Thor Love and Thunder. The movie has bright color scenes, dark scenes and black and white scenes, so I think the movie is a good test for the TV. I was very pleased with it.

For sports - I played around with several modes, including Sports, Theater Day and Theater Night. My original plan was to have a Theater Day settings with motion smoothing for sports, and everything else as Theater Night, but I decided it wasn't worth the effort for me. I enjoyed watching sports on Theater Night mode without motion smoothing, so that is what I kept. 4k Sports are incredible (I have seen football and soccer on it). Regular sports - I think baseball looks best, followed by football.

I had not used Google TV before - I am used to the Fire TV, but I found it easy to use. The setup on the TV is easy if you have the Google Home app. I have YouTube TV, and that goes very well with the Google TV.

For sound, I use the HDMI ARC port to the Hisense soundbar. I use eARC and passthrough - it seems to sound better to me than the other options (Auto / PCM / Dolby Digital /Dolby Digital Plus). I don't have a Dolby Atmos soundbar so I can't comment on the Dolby Atmos feed from the TV. The CEC works well with the soundbar as I can turn the soundbar and TV on and off and change the volume with the TV remote.

Overall, this TV is a great value, especially when I got it on a discount and during their $100 gift card promotion.",B09YVVQQN5,Gaming tv,Size: 77 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The picture quality on this TV is amazing. I'm replacing a TCL 5 series 55"" from 2018 and there is no comparison. The Hisense 75"" blows the TCL away from a picture standpoint. I will say that the ROKU browser on the TCL is more intuitive than the Google TV on the Hisesnse, but I'm sure I'll get used to it.
The 75"" appears to have an IPS panel so the picture doesn't degrade at an angle, but unlike most IPS panels I've seen this TV is capable of nice deep rich blacks with minimal blooming. I'm honestly blown away by the picture quality at such a low cost.
The fact that this TV has Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, EARC and local dimming at $799 is amazing.
The sound quality from the set itself is okay but not great. It gets sufficiently loud but sounds a little hollow. I connected it to my Atmos capable sound bar and the EARC allows for complete passthrough of uncompressed Dolby Atmos and DTS and of course you can control the volume of the soundbar with the TV remote. The remote, once paired to the bluetooth allows you to control the TV without having to point the remote at the TV.
The build quality seems to be fine if nothing special.
Now for the small issues that to me aren't a deal breaker but are definitely a nuisance.
1. Out of the box the remote will not pair. To fix this do the firmware upgrade.
2. The remote Now app will not pair with the TV. This is a must to use with Alexa. I have not found a work around for this. I could see this being a deal breaker for some but I'm more concerned with picture Quality.
Bottom Line: For $799 I would say this is a no brainer despite a few small issues.
I've only had the TV for a few days so I'll try to update this if anything changes.
Update: After less than a month of use I've had to take the set back to factory start up 3 times for various issues and am about to do it a 4th time.
1st major issue the TV for no reason stopped communicating with the sound bar so no sound.'
2nd major issue is that the guide has never worked for live TV.
3rd major issue and this is the worst of all. The TV comes on loads up and once you select a program to watch it goes into a reboot loop. The only way I've found to fix this is by doing a full factory restart. Having to factory rest a new product 4 times in less than a month is simply unacceptable.
Update: 70 days in and Google tv has stabilized and is working somewhat better. I still like Roku better.
The program guide on antenna TV is still not working.",B09YVVQQN5,Beautiful Ignore the Review Bombing,Size: 55 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I've purchased 2 of these in the 75 inch size. 1 tv has been great. Love the Google TV interface, very easy to setup and sign into my streaming apps. Oddly Youtube TV is buried in the apps section and you have go to all apps and then hold the OK button down to reorder things so that the apps you want show up on the google tv main page. Picture is great for the price, especially since I am coming from an older LG Plasma that isn't 4k.

The second tv though... yikes. Screen was dead on arrival. Hisense sent out a tech after some excruciating support calls, but it took 1.5 weeks to get someone out here. Tech basically was like yeah they are going to have to replace it, so he took all the tv internals out of it and put a huge X through the panel and then left. It then took 3 weeks for another new tv to be shipped to me. This was supposed to white glove setup service so they could verify that it worked fine. Instead the delivery team (3rd party company) dropped it off and said all they could do was bring it right inside my door, even though the outside of the box said room of choice delivery, unpack, assemble base, power on and check. Called Hisense immediately and support told me to just check it myself. This is a 75 inch tv and was crazy to ask me to just do that myself. In any case, I did and when I plugged it in the wall it was immediately clear that the panel had damage. Called support back again and they basically said they need to escalate my case. So now I have 2 broken 75 inch tvs taking up space in my house and have no idea what I am supposed to do with them. Hoping that they actually get me another tv before my 100 day guarantee runs out HA, and take away the two broken tv's since you can't just put them out at the curb or fit it my car. Absolute nightmare trying to get a working tv and the support is awful to deal with. No updates ever, I just keep needing to call back in to see if someone can check on my case.

So if you buy one, just hope it works out of the box, if not be ready for a poor support experience.",B09YVVQQN5,Hisense are the Best Price to Quality,Size: 42 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars

Took me 5-10 minutes to set up and ready to watch. Really good looking TV and the sound is great too. Bright during the day and there are many picture settings you can choose from. I’m not really into TVs that much but just wanted something nice but nothing too fancy. Well, this seems very fancy and I love it so far! For the price you can’t beat it. I did a lot research and this one hands down had the best specs and reviews for my budget. I also love that it comes with Pluto TV which is basically free cable.

I’m a big fan of Google so I like that I am able to connect my account to everything on the TV. The set up is pretty straightforward by just following all the prompts on the screen. The color is beautiful and the quality is amazing. It comes with legs to stand it up but I just put it up on my wall where the old TV was. It’s a pretty big television so it’s a little heavy but not too much. I’m a tiny person and I was able to lift it up with my teenager. So far I’m pretty happy with the way it operates and the picture quality.

"Hisense 65U6H review.
Bought this because of price and value, and because of positive reviews elsewhere. The two-year factory warranty also played a large role.
Took me a little over week to get it adjusted to the point where I can say it’s awesome.
I worked in broadcast TV engineering for a lot of my career, and am amazed at where video technology is today. One of the bittersweet things is the ability to adjust specific parameters.
Original main concerns were lack of ""texture"" and sharpness.
Got about 95% of the way to awesome via adjustments.
The thing that put it over the top to get to awesome was setting my Series 3 HD TiVo to ""native"" for the HDMI output. Now the Hisense TV does the correct video processing, and is not fighting with and dealing with the TiVo output. Plus the Hisense processing and conversion is 14 year newer technology.
There’s a lot of interaction between settings. Be patient. Make smaller adjustments, and you’ll likely reach a great picture.
Out of the box —- No DSE. Screen consistency is as perfect as I’ve ever seen. No dead pixels.
We use it mostly to watch television via cable, antenna and streaming.",B09YVVQQN5,"Nice TV, crappy remote...",Size: 55 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"We have had the 75"" set for nearly a month and we are very happy with the picture quality and performance so far.

This unit has an IPS panel vs. the VA panel that is reported on the smaller TVs of the same model. For us, that is not a problem as we rarely watch the set in complete darkness and the wider viewing angle works is a greater benefit. In complete darkness and with dark scenes, the back lighting is visible in the dark areas, but I really cannot say whether it is better or worse than a comparable VA unit - it's much better than our previous 8-10 year old TV (JVC BC50R).

Color reproduction is really great out of the box and we only did a minor amount of tweaking to our liking on top of the ""Theater Day"" mode. When not gaming, we have motion enhancement set to ""Film"" and it does enough to keep a natural look on anything we are watching. Motion enhancement turns off automatically if you have a video game console connected (PS4, Switch in our case), but it did not detect games started on our HTPC, and had to be turned off manually. To get the best color reproduction from your consoles, it's best to enable HDR and Full Range color on the console, then set the TV's ""HDMI Dynamic Range"" to ""Auto"" and ""Color Space"" to ""Native"". Setting ""Color Space"" to ""Auto"" seems to sometimes pick the wrong setting and your TV's color reproduction will be off from what the console is outputting.",B09YVVQQN5,Great picture and sound,Size: 42 inchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
" I bought a Hisense TV for my garage, as you can see it hanging on the wall. (I watch TV while I'm detailing my bike or working on other projects.) I liked it so much that when it came time to replace the TV in the living room, I went with Hisense again. I was not disappointed!

The Hisense new 'Quantum ULED' has a picture that is better than any other TV at this price point. (I did a lot of research.) The blacks are REALLY black. (I like this for the perceived depth of field.) The colors are super vivid and there are no breaks in gradient, like other TV's in this class. (There are no 'bands' in contrast from light to dark.) The images are crisp and clearly defined. I watch a lot of 4K streaming and the visual experience with this TV is fantastic.

It's internet ready and I had no problems connecting it to my home network. It works very well with Alexa. I also like that I have one button access to Prime Video and Netflix. My wife and I like movies and not having to deal with multiple remotes for that is very nice. The voice command feature is convenient and is a lot easier than scrolling through multiple commands using buttons.

It has all the wiring connections you could want, to hook it up to your home theater system. I used them all and the sound is fantastic.

"This tv has decent color and can get very bright, depending on the setting selected. I am not a fan of the control because it is small and rounded in the back, which makes it difficult to handle.

However, my biggest problem is with the television's ability to display YouTube, Netflix, and Disney. The image always shows up tiled/pixelated. You literally see a bunch of pixels. However, when I went into the tv's internet browser and loaded up YouTube, it shows the picture just fine. Also, if I plug in a fire stick, the picture shows up clear as well.

I spoke with several HISENSE reps, on their chat, and they weren't really helpful. They kept blaming my internet speed. It doesn't make sense that a firestick, using the same internet connection, can display a clear picture, but the actual tv is not able to. Even the tv's internet browser displays YouTube videos, but the actual HISENSE YouTube app does not.

I've tried turning off all the extra settings, with no success. The tv is only usable if you have a streaming device because the native apps have some issues and don't work properly.

"Never been a Hisense fan, but I am now. I’ve always solely purchased higher end Samsungs and Sony’s. But with funds tightening down these days I decided to save myself a grand and go with this TV. I’ve heard a lot of good feedback from TV enthusiasts on this particular model and I can confirm it’s pretty fantastic. Right out of the box the colors pop, GUI is zippy, and it’s just an attractive looking TV. I’m not a pixel peeper, but I rewatched all my favorite marvel movies for the first time in 4K and this TV delivered. Sound sucks, like on any TV, but it’s pretty standard practice to buy a soundbar or have a legit 5.1/7.1 setup these days so that can’t ever be a contributing factor for a lesser rating. You can see some negative reviews here, and that’s from some folks that don’t even own this model and just had a single bad experience with another Hisense model. Reality is some panels can be bad, from any brand. This is the best quality for the price imo. I’m still blown away I got it on sale here on Amazon for under a grand AND Hisense is going to give me $100 after 100 days as part of their promo just for keeping this TV.

" Although it does not have all of the gaming stuff that is says and is the reason I bought it, it's still a huge upgrade from the TV I had. It has the dts and e-arc and a few other things, and it measures 54.8 inches across which is 4 inches bigger than my old high sense that markets itself as a 55"" and overall it has a way better picture quality so I ended up keeping it even though it didn't have all the though stuff it claims to have.

Very bright. Accurate colors out of the box. Extremely low input lag. I’m seeing new detail in my games that my 2021 LG oled fails to show. OLED has an issue with crushing blacks this does not. Cannot believe this is only 1k for a 75” Also it most certainly does do 120hz @ 4k. You have to use 8k hdmi cables and set the hdmi input on the TV to enhanced to work.

"This isn't blooming - it even appears when the entire scene is black (e.g., a transition between scenes in a movie). There's about a 30cm x 20cm ovular area just above center where there's significant bleed through from the back light (if my understanding of LED is correct, the back light shouldn't even be on in such a scenario). After dealing with boxing the whole damn thing back up, I'm just going to spend the money on an OLED.

One other thing that is almost a show stopper - despite the settings seeming to support it, you can't turn off the soap opera effect in apps installed on the TV (e.g., Netflix, Amazon, etc); only works with the HDMI ports. So, to get decent looking movies, I had to plug in my Google TV Chromecast into my.. uh.. Google TV.

"I have the Costco version of this TV and while I'll admit, it was one of the hardest TV's to fine tune that I've ever owned....when the smoke cleared, it is beautiful. The BS I'm referring to is the reviewers screaming ""Hisense sucks"" ""awful support"" ""they make bad TV's"". It's garbage folks. Everytime you buy a TV....whether it's a Sony or LG or Samsung and yes, a Hisense...you run the risk of getting a bad one. It's why it's called the Panel Lottery"". This is my third Hisense...I also have a 50"" from 2017 and a 55"" from 2019. Zero problems with the 50"" but I had some bad dirty screen effect on the 55"" and Hisense had a new replacement at my door in 10 days. BTW, my 75"" U7H has no such trouble....my son informed me that the screen is every bit as clear as his 85"" Sony. So don't believe everything you read here. There's nothing wrong with Hisense that isn't wrong on any other major brand....with their 100 day/$100 promo they are out to prove it.

Other unhappy Hisense customers indicate that Hisense TVs often last between 1 and 2 years. I think that while all TV brands have issues, Hisense has far more than problems in warranty, and just out of warranty, compared to their competitors.

"My Amazon delivery team delivered my TV yesterday, so this is review based on 1 day of using this TV. The first issue I had is that to even use the TV you have to download the Samsung Smart Things app and go through a set up process that takes around 25 minutes. You cannot just plug and play. Once that was done, I was able to use the remote to navigate through the TV functions. The remote is sleek and user friendly and so is the Samsung TV menu. My other TV is a 2017 UHD TV by another top manufacturer, so my opinions of this TV are based on how much better this TV is compared to my existing one. I got this curved TV, because I have only owned flat screens previously. This TV is a 55"", so I didn't experience an immersed feeling like I would have if it were an 85"". However, the picture quality while watching a movie is excellent and it does feel like you could walk right into the screen. Vivid and rich colors. I did notice that around the perimeter of the TV screen that you can see very faint white shadows that take away from the screen ever being dark black while it is turned on. That is okay with me, because I am not a gamer where dark black colors seem to be important. This is not noticeable while watching a movie.
the most important thing to me is the picture quality during a movie. The speakers are awesome. I will not need to buy a soundbar. I am happy that I have a curved TV, but I think that if you are buying a curved TV for the immersed feeling like you are in a movie theater this a 55"" curved TV will not be for you. You may find a flat screen that will better suit your needs. The built in Alexa is an awesome plus for me and my smart home. I will also be using this screen as monitor, to edit media content. This will be amazing for that too! Lastly, to be able to use the free TV apps is AWESOME because I just cut off my satellite TV last week. There are a ton of free streaming apps built in. I highly recommend this TV, and I would buy another one if they came in 85"". Unfortunately, I have read that they are discontinued in that size. Excellent TV for me!",B08BTJ5JZ8,Decent budget TV,Size: 65Style: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"So I love the picture quality of this television. I was attracted to the price and the 5 star rating.

The sound isn't that great but then I attach the sound bar and now it's perfect. Standard sound just doesn't cut it for powerful movies.

I also find the control too small for my hand. It's built for people with really small hands. And it's sort of weird to use, the buttons just aren't in intuitive locations.

I purchased 2 of these televisions the 2nd one came with a different remote. So perhaps they listened.
I don't really know, I have not used the 2nd television and and therefore the 2nd remote.

But for the price for a curved screen the picture quality is stunning as well as all its abilities to minnick its background and connect to the Internet",B08BTJ5JZ8,Over all quality and price,Size: 65Style: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars

"We had owned a curved 55 inch Samsung for about 5 years and it worked perfectly. It was on at least 12 hours a day. Recently, a dark vertical ""cloud"" appeared over a section of the screen. While undesirable, the set was still ""usable"". Rather than trying to have it repaired, we decided to just purchase of new TV, this 65 inch curved Samsung.

The Amazon price for this set was very attractive. Due to a recent cable/phone/internet increases (no local competition) our yearly bill is now about $3600 a year! So, if you were to amortize the cost of this TV over 5 years, it is less than about $200 per YEAR. So, in comparison with the cable bill, the TV is, in effect, a ""consumable"".

The set arrived quickly. Delivery was excellent! Two Amazon people carefully brought the boxed set into my home. I did not ask for a custom installation and I don't believe it is needed by most. Just judge your ability to setup and use the myriad of phones and other electronics we now use.

The outer box was in perfect shape and the interior packing was excellent. Samsung even provides a ""curved"" piece of foam packing that you can lay the set's curved face safely down while installing the 2 feet. This was easy and moving the set to it's home on a table was not too hard for my wife and myself. The set is surprisingly lightweight but still needs a 2-person carry.

Initial power on was fine. There are a number of ""screens"" you have to respond to at first. For example, you're asked if you want to enable Alexa control. Although I have and like Alexa, I didn't want to add any complexity/confusion factors before verifying that the set worked. So, I turned down or ""skipped"" all of the initial questions I could.

The picture is excellent and I think the sound quality of this set is significantly better than the previous Samsung. I'm not talking about hi-fi or anything like that. I just would like to clearly understand words being spoken without needing an external audio system.

Picture quality is excellent. I don't know if the ""curved"" nature of this set enhances visibility or not. I just liked the design and never intended to wall mount. I did quickly research the different types of screen technology available but decided that this screen technology was fine considering price and availability and our needs. It is a very good picture.

I have been quite pleased with the quality and performance of Samsung TVs. The price here was lower than I expected for a replacement set. Setup was a snap.",B08BTJ5JZ8,Very good for the price.,Size: 65Style: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars

"Was very disappointed in the TV when I first plugged in and turned it on. No one at Xfinity or Samsung tells you that you need a special cable box to get the true 4K, color, and definition on the set. However, after scheduling a Samsung tech appointment and talking with an Xfinity agent, did I discover this information. I'm now putting the set through its paces, but it appears the issue with yellowish colors and no real HD definition has been resolved.

This issue is still unresolved. Color is off. Repair has ordered a new processor and if this doesn’t work, I will be returning the product!

Samsung came and looked at my set and found no error codes. However, the picture is still subpar! I'm sending it back for a replacement. If this one sucks too, I will be returning for a credit!",B08BTJ5JZ8,Good value for money when it's on sale,Size: 65-InchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars

"I have one complaint - it takes several minutes of onscreen keyboard typing to label a connection. If you disconnect that cable for even a second, the TV throws all that hard work in a fire and laughs at your pain.

Also, I can't comment on the smart features except that they are easily foiled by not connecting the TV to the internet (I already HAVE a gadget that spies on me and barfs ads in my face every waking second, thanks all the same - I don't need two).

" When I first ordered the TV, I was kind of scared because I never ordered something as big as this TV. I was afraid that it might get here with a crack in it, box damaged, all the usual stuff you would expect when things get shipped to your home. Amazon personally delivered it with extreme care and caution and I couldn't have been more happier. From the moment I plugged it in I appreciated how the screen looked. It's a beautiful picture. Can't really tell it's curved until you start scrolling through Netflix movies or going through the menus. Registered through the SmartThings app and the only thing that I couldn't get into was Hulu (which didn't matter because I still have Hulu on my Xbox One X). Games look absolutely beautiful and it's a whole experience playing Black Ops Cold War now. It was worth the money for me. I should have ordered a bigger stand though, but I'm in love with this TV! I'll update this in a few months and see if anything changes.

Update 10/16/21: TV still going strong. I initially had trouble getting the TV to ready my hard drive (5 TB) and I assumed because of the size of it that it was too large for the TV to read, but after an update, it reads my hard drive just fine. I didn't know to the extent that samsung electronics communicate with each other either. I bought a Samsung washer, now I get notifications when the laundry is done. An added and welcome bonus in my books. I noticed that the TV remote will control whichever device the TV is hooked up to. I dont have to do any additional programming or anything like that, all I have to do is plug into one of the HDMI ports in the back and I'm good to go. It saves money because now I don't have to buy any media remotes for my Playstation or Xbox. I'm still enjoying this TV and I'm glad I purchased it. Now the next test will be when I get my hands on a PS5 and a Xbox Series X. Right now I have a PS4 Pro and Xbox One X connected to it and I have them both set to 4K HDR and the picture is absolutely gorgeous. It's so beautiful that I'm considering getting a 75 inch for the living room. I have game mode set to auto on the TV, so it detects when I play games and enhances the picture even more.

"As I said, I was prepared to be disappointed but quite the opposite actually. Yes, the remote is a little thing and it's like pulling teeth to access the battery compartment, however, once I got the batteries in, the remote was pleasantly simple. The best part of the remote is that it automatically controls my Roku! Which means I can now put the Roku remote away especially since fhe Roku remote does not control volume. As for the picture, all I can say is WOW! What a picture! I've never experienced television like this. I didn't need a new TV, I had a 40"" Magnavox mounted on my dresser, it was fairly easy to exchange the old TV with the new. So far, I have only got a 5 star review to offer this curved glass 55"" and am very pleased with the 5 monthly payments of just under $100.
UNFORTUNATELY! 96 DAYS after I purchased it, a small vertical red line on the left side of the screen from top to bottom 4.5"" from the left side of the frame appeared. It came and went but now is here to stay but only while watching an actual program. It doesn't show up on the home screen while choosing a show or movie to watch, which I find strange.

"Bought to use as a pc monitor; general email, excel, PowerPoint, and teams work.

Setup was easy, 2 screws each to attach the legs and it was standing up. The body is pretty thin and flexes, but under 2 bills it’s forgivable.

Turned it on and there’s no way to bypass smart features and signed onto Amazon with wifi and all. Needed to update so gave it a few min.

The remote has no input button so have to navigate via the fire home screen which is pretty annoying. After first use, there’s a stacked panes button remote that’s for recent favorites and does in a way act as an input button. Tv doesn’t remember which input you leave on and boots to fire Home Screen every time. Couple more button presses in the morning I guess.

Screen is more than bright enough for desk work, I actually turned down brightness as I’m sitting about 2.5 ft away. Tv doesn’t do 4:4:4 chroma so text is not perfect but perfectly serviceable after a few tweaks; setting picture mode to pc and turning on super resolution seems to do the trick for now. Most general office work has black text against white in excel, outlook, teams, etc. don’t expect it to give me trouble reading wise but am aware it wouldn’t be the best monitor for detailed graphics nor critical PowerPoint where accurate colors are required. Attaching pictures of general office work and rtings chroma test: most are perfectly legible except the lowest two rows where there is some blur but legible, I don’t expect to read text in those color schemes for general office work.

A few surprises, this is actually natively airplay compatible and HomeKit. Airplay is always nice to have for a quick screen share from phone and HomeKit integration means I have a spare remote on my phone and it helps with the input button annoyance.

There is a slight window pane effect sitting this close, the utmost outer edge where the scroll bar would sit for many applications has an odd 3D effect, like it’s floating. Looks a little funny but not a show stopper.

Love the screen productivity this affords, it’s literally 4 x 21.5” at 1080p each, and with quick windows shortcuts (win+left+up, etc) it’s really easy to snap windows into a 4 grid to multitask or cross reference data.

Or it can offer massive screen real estate for spreadsheets and multiple word pages.

Now let’s hope it lasts.

Update***
While screen sharpness and text was not an issue, after a full day of work decided to return, the input lag was disruptive. Would have been fine for general home theater pc use but the typing lag was not conducive for work where I’m constantly firing off emails and messages.

Once you sign in with your Amazon account it basically just sets itself up. Picking it up from Best Buy was just as easy. Just show them your Amazon order number and they bring it right out to you. Honestly I wasn't expecting this great of picture quality from a TV under $300. I was pleasantly surprised. Will use this brand for some additional TV's we plan to put in the house.,B08X7KQQGJ,Perfect,Size: 55-InchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I use it for computer monitor, and the text is very sharp. You have an option of changing the type to PC.
I also use the computer to calibrate the text.
Other than that, some very minor negative:

1. It updates twice, meaning it can't get the latest and update. This is very minor.
2. It shows 4k youtube video in very good pictures, however, on some other video, the color is a bit off. It is very similar to when I compare Samsung $900 TV with $1700 TV. For $200 level monitor, it's a great deal.
3. The edges, when viewing close as a monitor, it reflects into the screen, and actually override the screen's edge, such as the scrollbar. This is a bit bigger issue. However, for $200 and very clear text, I would buy it again. Actually, I did, I bought one for my wife, then get another for myself.
4. The size is about perfect for monitor. The one it replaces is 48"", and I find myself having to move a bit left and right. When they make it curved (at low price), 48"" is probably fine.
5. This is not for game, at 4k, it works at 30 framerate, probably due to my computer, not the monitor, but it appears to support up to 60 frame per seconds. Still not for game, but not bad at all.

6. It has problem display some text not clearly, as black text in pink background, as seen in the attached picture. It is rare for many people to have this combination, but it's a minor problem anyway.

I would recommend this.",B08X7KQQGJ,"Crisp, vibrant picture. Poor sound quality.",Size: 32-InchStyle: TV Only,4.0 out of 5 stars

"You're here because you want a cheap TV. That's it. It's a TV that does TV stuff and it doesn't cost a lot. The picture is fine. You know you're getting trade offs for the price, so here's what they are:

-The speakers suck. They just do. Plan to be okay with that or get a soundbar.
-The built in smart stuff is probably fine for most people, but I prefer Apple TV. I don't even have this thing connected to wifi because I don't want Amazon tracking everything I do (""he says, as he writes this review on Amazon..."") but I'm sure Best Buy is getting a kickback for the usage of Fire TV (Insignia is a Best Buy house brand, if you didn't know).
-Because I don't use the built in smart stuff, it complains every time I turn it on that it's not connected to Wifi or Amazon. I use HDMI-CEC to control it through the Apple TV though, so I only see this message for a few seconds before it switches over. Annoying, but that's it.
-It's a little bulkier than a nicer TV would be, but again...you probably aren't here because you expect the slimness of an LG C1 on a $300 set.

Now for the bad, I don't like that every time I turn it on it comes up to the home screen instead of coming on to the last channel it was on when I turned it off. I'm a cord cutter and most of my TV viewing is over the air via antenna, requiring me to change input from the home screen every time I turn it on. Also after having this TV for 3 weeks it has totally locked up on about 8 occasions requiring a cold boot (unplugging the power cord) in order to reset.

"I was definitely hesitant given the reviews, but so far so good with one minor hiccup. I can't seem to get it to recognize my PC via HDMI. The PC recognizes the TV, the TV recognizes that something is plugged in, but it says no signal detected no matter what I've tried. Restarts, resets, plugging and unplugging, different cords, etc. I feel like I might be missing something simple.

That is not a dealbreaker, however, because it functions surprisingly well as a Smart TV. It's quick, no major delays or funkiness. Huge huge upgrade from the smart tvs of yesteryear, if that's holding anyone back. I've seen a lot of people complain about the ads, but they're confined to the home menu. You're not getting ads during Netflix or anything.

Overall I'm pretty pleased with this purchase, having paid about $250 out the door. I don't really need another computer monitor, so purely calling this a TV, it seems great, but longevity will be the true test.

Edit: Fixed the issue by setting the HDMI to 1.4 instead of 2.0 and it started working, but glitchy. Looks like it was a combination of that setting and a right-angle adapter I had on the pc end of the cable. Having changed those two things, it's now being used with my PC as well.",B08X7KQQGJ,Tv delivery,Size: 65-InchStyle: TV Only,5.0 out of 5 stars

"I found this during Prime Day, and got a hecka killer price. I wanted a Samsung, but alas its hard to find a 55"" Samsung model with all the features at a price I wanted.

I love the multiple HDMI hookups. You do not need a Firestick, so the one I have for my last TV is being used to hold papers down on my desk. The assembly was quick and easy. I am a senior and live alone so I was a bit worried that I might not be able to maneuver this out of the box and onto my TV stand, but I managed just fine. If you do unpack it alone, the easiest and safest thing to do is slide it out of the box onto your bed, hook up the legs [or stand if you go that direction], and hook up the power cord BEFORE you pick it up and put it down on the stand.

Wifi connection was a breeze, and the interface is just like the Firestick so its pretty easy to use and familiar to a veteran Firestick customer. Antenna driven TV was simple enough to add too, but I need to figure out if I can log into my Samsung account to get the on-air Samsung TV stuff.

I went through ALL the setting to try and change it. This is not in the display or sleep settings. I called Insignia tech support and the lady I spoke with said that it is build into the TV to shut down if paused to save energy. ??? Why after only 15 minutes?

"Pros:
- Great picture quality, especially for the price
- Good performance when using apps like youtube, netflix
- Decent enough menu systems

Cons:
- Fragile. A guest bumped his hand on the screen and it completely destroyed it. It was so light I didn't even notice it until much later when I turned the TV on. There was no visual damage (broken stuff) at all. Keep it clear of literally anything that could possibly hit it, no matter how soft.
- Too bright for night time. On a completely dark room, late at night, I see myself having to go into the settings to manual tweak down the ""contrast"" since the brightness can't go down enough. Problem is, this only works on active videos, not while you're (for instance) on the video selection screen.

"OUSTANDING PICTURE even using AIR ANTENNA I get 161 Channels I am 80 yrs young and it took a while to figure it out. Call Tech SUPPORT they can help you out. I figured out how to set the channels you want. I notice that when I change channels, I was getting a CIRCLE ARROW in the middle of the screen like it was searching for a channel so Went through the steps in the PICTURES follow the steps when you get to picture 10 select the channel you want because you might find 2 of the same channels that will cause your screen to search because you have 2 of the same channels Remove check mark for channels you want to remove and check what you want. When you are done finding your station go to each station it will say TUNING stay on that channel till the channel picture appears DO THIS TO ALL CHANNELS YOU WANT TO KEEP!!! You might need to do this after all FORMATTING!!!!! I hope this will help some seniors with ANTENNA. I purchase a remote RMF-TX500U Amazon said I can use it with my TV but TECH Support said NO it says I can't use it with Sony TV I bought it because it had numbers so I can select the channels by numbers, but Tech said NO.

"I don’t usually buy TVs sight-unseen, so I was really taking a chance. I’m thrilled to report that the gamble paid off! The picture clarity and color are just what I was hoping for. Considering this was at the top of the price-point that I was willing to spend at this time, I was concerned that I wouldn’t get a TV that I was happy with, without a 4-digit price tag. But no worries here. I caught it on sale and so far, so good. In regards to setup, that was easy enough, especially since I wasn’t connecting any other devices and only have a Prime Video subscription. Inserting the 2 pieces of the stand were literally, a snap. They are very sturdy and click right in to the underside of the TV. The remote has a simple setup, making screen navigation straightforward. I still have a lot of exploring to do, but I had pre-planned to make my first viewing experience on my new TV, “Lord of the Rings: Return of the King.” And that’s exactly what I am watching as I type this review.

Sony does their blacks well and their brights are bright it is the kind of movie quality I prefer in a TV. That being said, I am really pleased with LED tv.

Esta pantalla es ligeramente más cara que otras opciones de este tamaño pero se ve porqué de ese precio. Ya de entrada, a mí me encantó el acabado en color blanco que le da un toque diferente a lo que ya todos conocemos y la verdad que se ve muy mona la tv.

Aunque no es Full HD, en este tamaño viene bien el 720p y a cierta distancia no notas ningún problema. La imagen es muy agradable y el sistema... wow. Es la primera ves que uso WebOS y la verdad me encantó. Hay fluidez en los menús, muchas opciones súper útiles (por ejemplo: el aspect radio que a los retro gamers les vendrá bien).

"Bought to use as a pc monitor; general email, excel, PowerPoint, and teams work.

Setup was easy, 2 screws each to attach the legs and it was standing up. The body is pretty thin and flexes, but under 2 bills it’s forgivable.

Turned it on and there’s no way to bypass smart features and signed onto Amazon with wifi and all. Needed to update so gave it a few min.

The remote has no input button so have to navigate via the fire home screen which is pretty annoying. After first use, there’s a stacked panes button remote that’s for recent favorites and does in a way act as an input button. Tv doesn’t remember which input you leave on and boots to fire Home Screen every time. Couple more button presses in the morning I guess.

Screen is more than bright enough for desk work, I actually turned down brightness as I’m sitting about 2.5 ft away. Tv doesn’t do 4:4:4 chroma so text is not perfect but perfectly serviceable after a few tweaks; setting picture mode to pc and turning on super resolution seems to do the trick for now. Most general office work has black text against white in excel, outlook, teams, etc. don’t expect it to give me trouble reading wise but am aware it wouldn’t be the best monitor for detailed graphics nor critical PowerPoint where accurate colors are required. Attaching pictures of general office work and rtings chroma test: most are perfectly legible except the lowest two rows where there is some blur but legible, I don’t expect to read text in those color schemes for general office work.

A few surprises, this is actually natively airplay compatible and HomeKit. Airplay is always nice to have for a quick screen share from phone and HomeKit integration means I have a spare remote on my phone and it helps with the input button annoyance.

There is a slight window pane effect sitting this close, the utmost outer edge where the scroll bar would sit for many applications has an odd 3D effect, like it’s floating. Looks a little funny but not a show stopper.

Love the screen productivity this affords, it’s literally 4 x 21.5” at 1080p each, and with quick windows shortcuts (win+left+up, etc) it’s really easy to snap windows into a 4 grid to multitask or cross reference data.

Or it can offer massive screen real estate for spreadsheets and multiple word pages.

Now let’s hope it lasts.

Update***
While screen sharpness and text was not an issue, after a full day of work decided to return, the input lag was disruptive. Would have been fine for general home theater pc use but the typing lag was not conducive for work where I’m constantly firing off emails and messages.

Once you sign in with your Amazon account it basically just sets itself up. Picking it up from Best Buy was just as easy. Just show them your Amazon order number and they bring it right out to you.

"I use it for computer monitor, and the text is very sharp. You have an option of changing the type to PC.
I also use the computer to calibrate the text.
Other than that, some very minor negative:

1. It updates twice, meaning it can't get the latest and update. This is very minor.
2. It shows 4k youtube video in very good pictures, however, on some other video, the color is a bit off. It is very similar to when I compare Samsung $900 TV with $1700 TV. For $200 level monitor, it's a great deal.
3. The edges, when viewing close as a monitor, it reflects into the screen, and actually override the screen's edge, such as the scrollbar. This is a bit bigger issue. However, for $200 and very clear text, I would buy it again. Actually, I did, I bought one for my wife, then get another for myself.
4. The size is about perfect for monitor. The one it replaces is 48"", and I find myself having to move a bit left and right. When they make it curved (at low price), 48"" is probably fine.
5. This is not for game, at 4k, it works at 30 framerate, probably due to my computer, not the monitor, but it appears to support up to 60 frame per seconds. Still not for game, but not bad at all.

6. It has problem display some text not clearly, as black text in pink background, as seen in the attached picture. It is rare for many people to have this combination, but it's a minor problem anyway.

"You're here because you want a cheap TV. That's it. It's a TV that does TV stuff and it doesn't cost a lot. The picture is fine. You know you're getting trade offs for the price, so here's what they are:

-The speakers suck. They just do. Plan to be okay with that or get a soundbar.
-The built in smart stuff is probably fine for most people, but I prefer Apple TV. I don't even have this thing connected to wifi because I don't want Amazon tracking everything I do (""he says, as he writes this review on Amazon..."") but I'm sure Best Buy is getting a kickback for the usage of Fire TV (Insignia is a Best Buy house brand, if you didn't know).
-Because I don't use the built in smart stuff, it complains every time I turn it on that it's not connected to Wifi or Amazon. I use HDMI-CEC to control it through the Apple TV though, so I only see this message for a few seconds before it switches over. Annoying, but that's it.
-It's a little bulkier than a nicer TV would be, but again...you probably aren't here because you expect the slimness of an LG C1 on a $300 set.

"I was definitely hesitant given the reviews, but so far so good with one minor hiccup. I can't seem to get it to recognize my PC via HDMI. The PC recognizes the TV, the TV recognizes that something is plugged in, but it says no signal detected no matter what I've tried. Restarts, resets, plugging and unplugging, different cords, etc. I feel like I might be missing something simple.

That is not a dealbreaker, however, because it functions surprisingly well as a Smart TV. It's quick, no major delays or funkiness. Huge huge upgrade from the smart tvs of yesteryear, if that's holding anyone back. I've seen a lot of people complain about the ads, but they're confined to the home menu. You're not getting ads during Netflix or anything.

Overall I'm pretty pleased with this purchase, having paid about $250 out the door. I don't really need another computer monitor, so purely calling this a TV, it seems great, but longevity will be the true test.

Edit: Fixed the issue by setting the HDMI to 1.4 instead of 2.0 and it started working, but glitchy. Looks like it was a combination of that setting and a right-angle adapter I had on the pc end of the cable.

"I found this during Prime Day, and got a hecka killer price. I wanted a Samsung, but alas its hard to find a 55"" Samsung model with all the features at a price I wanted.

I love the multiple HDMI hookups. You do not need a Firestick, so the one I have for my last TV is being used to hold papers down on my desk. The assembly was quick and easy. I am a senior and live alone so I was a bit worried that I might not be able to maneuver this out of the box and onto my TV stand, but I managed just fine. If you do unpack it alone, the easiest and safest thing to do is slide it out of the box onto your bed, hook up the legs [or stand if you go that direction], and hook up the power cord BEFORE you pick it up and put it down on the stand.

Wifi connection was a breeze, and the interface is just like the Firestick so its pretty easy to use and familiar to a veteran Firestick customer. Antenna driven TV was simple enough to add too, but I need to figure out if I can log into my Samsung account to get the on-air Samsung TV stuff.

"------------------- UPDATE June 17, 2022 -----------------------
I just wanted to come back and clear a few things up since my initial review:
PRICING
-First off, I had mentioned that the Google (50U6G1) version of this same TV was $130 cheaper. However, since then, the price has dropped for this TV -- by $130. When I got this TV, it was $529 and the Google TV version was $399, which was confusing. However, this TV has now dropped to $399 to match the Google TV version (Kudos to Amazon/Hisense for doing this). I was never quite sure why the Fire TV version was so much more, so good move. BTW, there also is an Android version (50U6G), which is only $348 but it does not include Google TV or Fire TV. At $399, this is a great deal and a no-brainer at this price point. I also want to mention that between the two other models (50U6G1 and 50U6G), the Google TV version (with the ""1"" at the end of the model No.) has a two-year warranty, while the other (Android) version only has a one-year warranty. This particular model I am reviewing (50U6HF) has a two-year warranty as well. ...

YOU GET A STAR!
-Second, I am bumping it up one star for two reasons. First off, one of the main issues I had before was the Dirty Screen Effects (DSE), but that has mostly gone away after nearly a week. But if you do have DSE, the best way to deal with it is to turn off the TV for around 30 seconds and turn it back on. Also, the effect will be much less noticeable if you turn down ""Local Dimming"" and ""Local Contrast Enhancement."" while not watching movies/TV shows. I also use this TV as a PC monitor so I keep my dimming and contrast settings on low to medium, which works best for me. YMMV.
The other reason for giving this TV another star in this review is because of the pricing mentioned in my first bullet point. At $399, this is an awesome value. Again, this also comes with a two-year warranty, which gives some peace of mind.

---------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW on June 11, 2022-----------------------------
This one is odd. Some of the features of this Hisense TV are incredible, and at first, it seems to be a great value. However, some features (or lack thereof) are plain head-scratchers, and upon further investigation, the value may not be as great as it appears. I will try to explain. I'll mix the good with the bad here ...

-THE PICTURE IS AMAZING ...
When I first got this TV, I was blown away by the level of contrast I was able to obtain without light bleeding into darker areas. I was also very impressed with the vividness of the reds, blues and greens. They are really getting VERY close to OLED with these QLED TVs in terms of saturation and contrast. Finally, the 600 nits of brightness is incredible for this price point. The screen can be beautiful at times, and very bright. Furthermore, the matte covering is good at diminishing reflected light.

... EXCEPT WHEN IT ISN""T
And while enhanced features such as local dimming and local contrast enhancement look good while watching content, be aware of (DSE) Dirty Screen Effect artifacting. This is phenomenon in which certain areas of the screen will be darker than others and is extremely noticeable when one color, especially gray, is shown on the screen. This was a very noticeable issue when I first go the TV, but usually powering off he TV, unplugging it for 30 seconds, and then plugging it back in resolves the issue.

-GREAT FOR GAMING
I have a gaming PC and an XBox Series X plugged into this and games look much better than my previous TV, a TCL Roku TV. The colors are brighter, contrast is better and HDR looks outstanding. The variable refresh rate is also a nice feature that allows the TVs refresh rate to match the game's frame rate to prevent screen tearing and other issues. Latency is also very low in game mode.

-OO-OOH THAT SMELL
Ever heard of new TV smell? It wasn't something I was aware of until I bought my last TV and it was very noticeable on this TV. That new 'burnt electronic' smell lingered for several days. So much so that I had to burn some candles to mask it.

-INPUTS ARE LACKING.
First off, this is the first time I've ever bought a flat-panel TV with inputs on the left side. I've been purchasing flat-panel/digital TVs for 20 years and they've always been on the right side. Every. Time. This required me to have to repurchase all new (and longer) HDMI and optical audio cables for every input, and these cables are not cheap.
The eARC input is a nice touch and allows your TV to ""communicate"" with your audio device and control the volume, etc. As for HDMI, the website lists the specs at HDMI 2.1, however, my GPU sees it as HDMI 2.0, even though I have a very high bandwidth cable (and tested a few). I was never able to get a full 10-bit HDR and 4:4:4 chroma, so I have to believe these inputs are only 2.0. It even says so in the settings menu (see image).
TIP: If you want 4K video at 60Hz with HDR content, make sure you get HDMI cables that are rated for at least 18Gbps.

-SOUND ISN'T BAD
For a small, flat panel TV, the built-in speakers are some of the best I've heard in a TV. I don't usually use them -- I usually opt for a soundbar or receiver -- but I tested them out for this review and they sound very nice and would work great in a pinch, or if you don't have external speakers.

-LACKLUSTER REMOTE CONTROL
The remote control is basically just a Fire Stick remote. There are no numbers, no ""last"" button and no ""input"" button. Switching from one input to another requires at least three button pushes. The settings feature is very sluggish and can take between 300 ms to 2 full seconds to open on your screen.

-DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE 240.
Motion Enhancement option does not exist. They put the number 240 out there as a ploy. The panel refreshes at 60Hz, not 240, not 120. They just conveniently chose the number 240, which just so happens to be a dividend of (divisible by) 60 and is the refresh rate chosen by many top-name monitors and TVs. It's nothing more than a bogus marketing term. It means nothing. As a matter of fact, this model of TV doesn't even have a ""motion enhancement"" setting that many others have, which can interpolate and smooth out frames to give the effect of a higher refresh rate. Nope, nothing to see here, and that's very disappointing, especially if you're a gamer.

-POOR MENUS AND CUSTOMIZATION
I'm not a fan of the Fire TV interface. I really like Google Play and feel very limited by what can be done with Amazon. The ""Talk to switch inputs"" thing is overrated and underused. The lack of customization is especially annoying to me because I use mine in a home theater PC setup so the HDMI is connected to a PC. There is NO way to label the input as such. This has been an option on all my TVs going back to the mid 2000s. It's mindboggling that they didn't include ""Computer"" or ""PC"" as an input option -- or just allow you to manually name the input.

-OVERPRICED
There is another model. the 50U6G (look it up and compare) that is spec-for-spec identical to this TV except in one respect: It has Google TV compared with Fire TV. The other difference? It is currently $130 cheaper than this model. Here's the thing: You could buy that other model and a $40 Fire stick and have -- basically -- the exact same thing if that's what you want. However, I fail to see how Fire is worth any more than Google. I would say many people might actually prefer Google for its Play Store, which is the standard for Android-based operating systems. I really have no idea why this TV is priced so much higher -- maybe it's because it's newer? I don't know, but it's not worth the price difference and this is one of the reasons I am rating is so poorly.

-OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
I like this TV. It is missing some features I would like to have, but it also has a great picture. What troubles me is the price. If this were competitive with the Google TV version, I would give this at least 4 stars, I'd still deduct one star for some of the dirty screen effects and poor customization. I may come back and bump up my rating if the TV grows on me and some of the dirty screen effects go away; but for now, it's pretty average, so 3 stars it is.",B09WNJT9X3,Has some drawbacks mostly with remote,,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at
50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.

I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.

Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.

I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.

I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.

Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.

Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.

Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.

So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV. I did for my purposes--got a great monitor, much better movie viewing in my office when I so desire and it's not really hard to operate and handle many inputs. I'd buy another HISENSE as a main TV on their upper tier.

If you're thinking you're going to get OLED or some competitors quality at a steal--not quite but very close .",B09WNJT9X3,Impressive LG smart TV with all the bells and whistles.,,5.0 out of 5 stars
"TLDR: Has a clean picture and is very bright. The picture does need a lot of tweaking to get colors, brightness, and white balance right. Good amount of obstacles is you don’t want to use the Fire TV interface.

If you’re looking to upgrade from 1080p to 4K, or just to a newer TV, you may not notice a big difference with this one.

Review:
This TV was a lower cost upgrade to from an older 1080p Samsung I was using. I don’t want to use Fire TV, so I connected my Roku to it.

You can bypass hooking it up to wifi and logging into Amazon, but the interface obviously pushes it on you. It will give you annoying notifications every time you turn on the TV, but these can be turned off in the settings.

One definite factor is the picture. You really need to go back and forth tweaking the picture to get it right. I ultimately had to do a side by side with another TV to get the settings right. I’ll add my setup at the end.

Pros:
- Crisp, clean picture quality.
- Very bright and colors can be very bright (also a con)
- Can use with other streaming devices (Roku, Apple TV)
- Lower price

Cons:
- Settings require a good amount of setup, especially the picture settings
- The blacks on this TV aren’t the best. Again, you have to really play with the settings to get the right depth and shadows.
- Even after adjusting the picture some colors remain very bright — deep pink, bright yellow, and any neons are all quite outstanding relative to other colors.
- The picture is not as good if your viewing from the side.
- Fire TV interface is annoying and kinda clunky.

"I ordered this to replace a maybe 10 year old maybe 47” TV in our living room. I had asked my dad who is a TV buff about the brand since I hadn’t heard of it and he said it’s well known for being a great budget friendly option and this was priced much less than the 43” Sony Tv I recently ordered for my bedroom. The screen isn’t significantly larger than the TV we had in the living room before and the TV itself is actually a bit smaller as this one has pretty much no frame. This one is also so much lighter and thinner than the old TV. It was super easy to just swap it out on the old mount and was up and running in about 20 minutes. So far the picture is great. I’ve only had a chance to watch cartoons with my toddlers but I was pleasantly surprised with how bright the colors are and how sharp all the lines are. I struggle with halos in my vision really bad after lasik surgery and some of the newer TV’s are so bright that I actually get halos all over the Tv screen and it makes the picture super blurry for me especially when something bright is on a dark background like the fire stick menu etc. I haven’t noticed that issue at all with this Tv which is very nice. I knew this had the built in fire stick but I was surprised to see that remote is basically a fire stick remote. I’m used to having to program my fire stick remote to work with my TV so that was nice but it also took some getting used to a TV remote without many buttons. We love fire sticks in our house but we find we usually have to replace them every 2 years or so because they just get run down and slow. I’m a little worried about that with it being built into the TV. I’m not sure what we would do if it starts slowing down. So far the only issue I’ve run into is that it didn’t have the proper port for our sound bar to plug into. The only port was much larger than the cord we have. I’m sure the port it has is higher quality but it’s frustrating to have to figure out how I’m going to plug in my sound bar. The sound from the TV itself is much better than our old Tv so it’s definitely tolerable until I can figure it out. One thing I noticed with the sound though is that the background noises/music seemed very loud compared to the main voices etc. I kept turning it up so I could hear the characters talking but then the background was too loud. It’s kind of hard to explain. Hopefully I can mess with some settings and figure it out. Overall we really like this Tv so far and I think it will be great for our living room. If you’re looking for a great quality Tv for a more budget friendly price I definitely recommend checking this out.
I wanted to add to my review after a couple days of use that I cannot find any sort of buttons on the TV itself. We frequently lose our remote and just turn our tv off by hand at bedtime and find the remote the next day… it’s not quite possible to do that with this TV",B09WNJT9X3,NICE,,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I was lucky enough to score this TV for $159 during a Lightning Deal. I'm overly impressed with the quality for the price. Setting it up could not have been easier. I bought it to replace an older Insignia Fire TV. This TV has both Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision support. Out the box I didn't have to fool with any calibration settings. For my Xbox Series S, I simply changed the picture mode to Game mode and have had zero issues with it. The colors really pop and I have not noticed any lag between gaming.

My only complaints are rather minor. While the colors do pop, this is not going to touch most higher end TVs as far as noticing a ton of details. Also, with it being a Fire TV, certain settings are ""dumbed down"" meaning less control over customization. Even with Dolby Vision as an option, my Series S tells me turning it on could lead to input lag. Additionally, just like my old Fire TV, naming HDMIs proves to be frustrating. You have to choose from preset naming choices and Amazon has apparently never heard of Nintendo. Xbox and Playstation is there, but you are stuck with ""Gaming Console"" for Nintendo Switch.

Even at the current sale price of $339, this is a great, basic TV that really shines for most uses. If you are a power user, or looking for more customization options, I would steer clear of the Fire TV version. But for the average user, or as a spare TV in an office or bedroom, this TV will be more than adequate for your uses.",B09WNJT9X3,Great buy,,5.0 out of 5 stars
"There is no better value $ of a TV than this. If I were to spend anymore it would be for a hisense u8h $$ , then lg c1 $$$ then Samsung s95b. $$$$. ($500 increments)
This u6hF has a fire cube 2022 built in , as it plays Dolby vision on prime video (only a firestick 4k max and the new fire cube 2022 cube can do that) it has almost 11.77gb of memory available (a fire stick 4k max only has 5.33)
Picture quality is great out of the box, I'm 100% satisfied while setting HDR Dolby vision mode to ""vivid"" and SDR to ""dynamic"". Sure you can fine tune it further but that's not necessary. It really squeezes out all the vibrancy from this tv as it's not too bright at 600 nits rated but you can squeeze out almost 700.
Vocals are clear as there's two sound settings ""dialog clarity"" in the TV sound settings and ""ac4 dialog enhancer"" in the Fire sound settings. Put both on medium and you are golden.

Had an issue pairing the remote to the tv during setup. Trick was to unplug tv, hold the home button on the remote for 10 seconds till the lights blink... then plug in the TV and set it up.
In 65"" size.
$500 get the Hisense u6h
$1000 get the Hisense u8h
$1500 get LG C1 (if you can find it)

"This Hisense U6HF is the first TV from this brand that I have ever tried, and I can't say anything bad about the panel itself (and there is very little to gripe about for this price, period). You get an excellent looking 50"" TV that has a peak brightness of 600 nits, this is so very important for HDR gaming and consuming Dolby Vision content. It's a shame that many brands try to obscure the brightness of their TVs because they know that the number looks bad (Most 4k TVs are less than 300 nits, yet they are still marketed as being HDR/Dolby Vision capable). Not Hisense though, the 600 nits of peak brightness is right on the box, so good on them for making it easy to find and for the panel being consistent with that number. It supports both Dolby Vision and HDR10+, which are the two formats that use dynamic metadata to allow the brightness to adjust on a scene-by-scene basis, which is better than regular HDR10 which uses static metadata.

Most Hisense TVs use Android/Google TV platform, but this is using Amazon's Fire TV operating system. Whether or not that is a plus or a minus probably depends on each individual's personal preference. I honestly would prefer just about anything else except for Vizio's janky Smartcast OS. It's not that I really have a problem with Fire TV OS itself, it's really more of the shenanigans that Amazon tries to pull, like full screen ads that randomly pop up and cannot be disabled. They also like to place pre-roll ads in their Prime Video originals, they can be skipped but why should we have to deal with that for a *PAID* service? Dear Amazon, please just stop. You are embarrassing yourself with your overaggressive need to milk us for additional ad revenue.

At least you can basically now get all the major apps from the Fire TV appstore, in the past, there were issues with YouTube, YouTube TV, and HBOMax. They could always disappear again though, since Google and Amazon have been fighting about this type of stuff for years. Currently the two are playing nice together, but you never know what might happen in the future. It would probably be possible to sideload the Android TV apps, since Fire TV is the same basic OS under the hood.

For people who have a PS5 or Xbox Series console, this TV does support auto low latency mode and VRR, but you need to update the TV out of the box for VRR to work. It works automatically after the update, just enable it on your console and your will be good to go. PS5 games look really great on this TV, just like shows and movies do. I am impressed with the kind of picture quality and HDR performance that you can buy at this price point in 2022. Ultimately though, if there ends up being an Android TV version of this same TV available, I think I would recommend that instead (because of the annoying things about Fire OS). Unless you are just a huge Alexa fan and you are already invested into Amazon's hardware ecosystem. You can do things like control this TV using an Echo smart speaker. I don't know how useful that is a specific individual but it is an option. This TV does also support HomeKit, so you can AirPlay content from an iPhone/iPad and control basic things from within the Home app on iOS and MacOS.

Pros+

Great panel with really good peak brightness, HDR content and games look awesome

Good contrast ratio and wide color gamut, quantum dot colors

VRR and Auto Low Latency Mode makes this a good option for PS5 and Xbox Series S/X owners

Alexa and Homekit integration

Relatively affordable for less than $550

Cons-

Fire OS is not my favorite because they like to sneak in Ads that can't be disabled, sometimes full screen ads instead of the screensaver (even if you have set up everything properly and turned off the advertising settings",B09WNJT9X3,"happy with price, delivery, quality",,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I got this to have a TV in the bedroom, so it isn't used for gaming or much else but watching TV. The Alexa integration doesn't matter to me, but some will find it handy. I already have a Prime video subscription.

Pros:

> It was easy to set up with my Prime subscription. All the features of Firestick without having to have an external device.
> We can watch our favorite subscription-based channels: Disney, Netflix, Hulu. Plus the app for Philo (our streaming TV) was included in the options. It doesn't have ALL the same features as our AppleTV does, but I like it better than Roku.
> I was able to easily connect an external antenna for local channels. I can even pause live TV for a short time!
> Great picture and sound. And dimmable for nighttime watching.
> Lots of HDMI ports for additional devices.
> The remote is easy to operate. Simple buttons.
> The sound and picture have many customizable settings to tweak it to your favorite.

Cons:
> Feet are spaced wide at the bottom, so it can't sit on a smaller table or stand and overlap. I have it on a wide console.
> One night, I heard voices, like a TV show playing in the background. It was creepy because the TV was off. I turned the TV on and off and the sound stopped. I'm assuming it did some sort of update and partially turned on at night? Either way, it was odd.
> Needs a strong internet signal or else programs will not load. Even if my phone has a signal of 50%, the TV seems to require more. Thus, it needs to be close to a wifi source.

Overall, I'm impressed! I haven't figured out yet how to customize the home screen to eliminate the stuff I don't use. It's busy and has a lot of ""free"" channels cluttering it up. At least what I've recently watched shows at the top.",B09WNJT9X3,love it,,1.0 out of 5 stars
"For folks who are after an affordable TV with a simple interface, great picture, and a solid design, the U6H is absolutely worth investing. This TV has Firestick interface on board for all your apps and a bright and colorful screen.

Pros:
- Crisp, clean picture quality.
- Very bright and colors can be very bright (Vivid)
- Compatible with other streaming devices (Apple TV..etc)
- Reasnable price

Cons:
- Settings require a good amount of setup, especially the picture settings
- Disappointed with 60Hz vs. 120Hz
- Even after adjusting the picture some colors remain very bright — deep pink, bright yellow and neons standout relative to other colors.
- The picture is not as good if your viewing from the side.

"I received this product as a gift hence it not appearing as a verified purchase

This FireTV remote that comes with apparently uses nonstandard IR codes that even a Fire Cube can't be programmed to understand. But why would I use a Fire Cube on a TV that already has FireTV capabilities? Well I want to be able to control the TV hands-free. The Fire Cube should be able to switch inputs, pause, change volume, rewind, all that good stuff. But sadly, this TV has a whack remote with its own special IR codes that even another Amazon product like the Fire Cube can't replicate meaning that by switching to a FireTV I lost all hands-free voice functionality except for power on/off.

Another issue with this tv is having it connected to a computer. As some artifact of its smartness, and the way it seems to sleep instead of completely turn off, it messes with other displays connected to the same computer. Now when I have this TV connected to my computer, whether the tv is on or off and regardless of the input, every hour or so it will make my computer monitors flicker and turn off for ~10-20 seconds. This ends up being way more annoying and problematic than I make it sound and I have gotten to the point where every morning I unplug the tv hdmi cord from my computer and then I plug it back into the tv in the evening if I want to stream anything to it. Just another hassle and detriment to the tv compared to any normal television due to its 'special' firetv nature.

I like the picture more than my old tv, but not being able to pair it with a FireCube and having to actually keep track of my remote is such a hassle, I feel like I went back 5 years in tech needing to press a button on my remote to use a voice command. The connectivity issues are also a problem. Overall having a FireTV feels whack, it feels like a locked down TV for children, or like a jitterbug phone for the elderly, dumbed down features and functionality for no apparent benefit for most users. The picture is good and the sound is decent, but all the other small details I dislike. I really wish this had just been a normal TV, then it would have been great. As it stands a firetv is a white elephant of a gift, imo. I highly suggest getting a normal TV and adding another device for fire functionality if that you really want it.",B09WNJT9X3,Great TV,,5.0 out of 5 stars
"This TV is probably the best you can get for the price (wait until stock is replenished and the price goes back down to around $350) but you really need to adjust the picture and sound settings out of the box! Some folks are complaining about the picture, and saying sound can’t be adjusted. Not true.

To change video settings you need to do so from within a video app (such as Netflix) while watching something. There are different video settings for when you’re watching standard high definition, or HDR (Dolby vision). I was watching breaking bad (standard high definition) and the picture was ridiculously artificial and over saturated. I changed the video settings to “movie” and the white balance to “standard” and it improved tremendously. I then switched to a show in Dolby Vision, and it looked awesome! The default settings were much better. The picture quality can’t quite compete with my Bravia, but for half the price…

As far as audio, I found the default way too trebly and harsh. I turned the bass up a couple clicks, and the treble way down, and it sounds good!

I also don’t really understand complaints about the Fire TV interface. To me it’s user friendly, intuitive, and faster than my more expensive Sony Bravia Android tv.

Besides the increasingly positive reviews for Hisense TVs, part of the reason I chose this TV was because it’s the only one I could find with legs close enough together to fit where I needed it to go. Now that I’ve used the tv for a couple weeks, I think it was my best option regardless.",B09WNJT9X3,Very happy with my purchase,,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm going to keep this review short and sweet so here's my likes/dislikes first.

What do I like?
*Great picture quality nearly matching OLED
*Out of the box optimal color calibration
*Backlight gets really bright especially in SDR
*Features VRR and is AMD FreeSync compatible
*HDR looks good but not great considering 600 nits
*Fire TV works well and is generally a lag-free experience
*The price is just right and it's a model from this year

What I didn't like?
*Viewing angles aren't great unless you are watching from center
*Fire TV has an obnoxious number of updates to download
*60Hz in 2022 when 120Hz should be the standard in televisions by now
*10-watt speakers are loud but lacking booming bass so get sound bar for it

I highly recommend the Hisense 50U6HF if you're looking for a great affordable QLED 4K TV with VRR. It's exceptional at what it does and gets most things right in what matters without breaking the bank.",B09WNJT9X3,This TV is unbelievable for the price,,4.0 out of 5 stars

"Pros: Uniformity, picture, local dimming, no DSE, HDMI 4K 60Hz eARC, Dolby Vision, Price.
Cons (not really at this price): VA panel limitations, some blooming, limited picture settings.

Pics left to right: DSE test and a 4K picture quality test.

Impressive for the price. Our 4th delivered TV from Amazon in 15 years. Worked perfectly out of the box. I won the panel lottery, no DSE (unlike the Samsung QN90A I returned). The set updates itself online and updates the remote to work with connected devices if CEC is left on, a nice touch.

The picture quality is very good out of the box. I looked in the settings to tweak but wound up leaving it default (do not expect many picture options at this price level). I am not noticing any stutter or judder to overly complain about. I tested the HDMI 2.1 eARC port with a 2.1 ATV 4k in iTunes, Edge of Tomorrow and Dolby Vision works great on the TV at 60hz, these ports are both 2.1 questionable. The TV reports DV properly. In letterbox the DV logo with reveal blooming, I did not notice it otherwise during normal viewing. SDR and HDR Brightness looks fine to me, some future reviews will most likely test it.

I have not tested the FTV interface so cannot comment on that yet. I also have not gamed on it yet. The VA Panel will have color wash if sitting off to the sides but that is to be expected. The detail is very good otherwise.

As a bedroom or office TV, this is a no brainer homerun. Even as a main viewing set it is still a very decent low-price option. I will consider this brand in the future.

When playing with a Nintendo switch the picture doesn't go to the four corners, but PS5 is fine. UI could be a little better and screen mirroring is wonky. But my BIGGEST gripe, is that it puts off an odor. Smells like a circuit board (a strange thing to say, I know), but it's not a burning smell or anything. Best thing for non gaming are the apps.

The on/off button was hard to find and sometimes it won’t turn off by remote or the button. The firetv system sucks! Apps I have downloaded disappear and have to be redownloaded. Buttons keep disappearing from the Home Screen. There was a button to look at all your apps which is suddenly gone, the search button is gone, the Hulu app button is gone. Downloading new apps is difficult. I am used to using Roku which was easy to see all available apps, can’t find that here. And without the my apps button I can’t figure out how to get to channels that don’t appear on the home page. It takes forever to download an app even though my Wi-Fi is hardwired to the tv. It spins forever if you let it, you have to use the back button and then go back to the app to get to a set up page which is another adventure. To sign up for new paid channels you have to go thru a whole rigamarole of setting up accounts and payment which was so easy on Roku and unnecessarily complicated here. Firetv also doesn’t offer any free trials of paid channels or if it does they are not listed anywhere.

I have used this size for desktop applications for years now and this is just the latest iteration for me. I love the 43in size for productivity as I can have four good sized windows open at any time and quickly move between them. I was worried that my potato of a work provided laptop would not run the 4k screen (and the provided docking station did not) but with some work I got a thunderbolt dock hooked up and was good for the full 4k 60p. I know that this size is not for everyone but for me I looked at a lot of different options even ended up with the 49in ultra wide in my cart at one point but the price of this is unbeatable. You could spend $1000 dollars on an ultrawide or you could get this for less than $400 I mean it is hard to make any other decision really. Now on to how it looks. it is not super bright or extra deep colors but for office work it is perfect in my book. I also own the new 42in oled for home use and it is no comparison the oled thrashes this in every possible metric but it is also nearly three times the price so it better. My only real gripe with these screens is that at arms distance away the corners get a bit soft. This is not a deal breaker but you will find your self shifting to find the close button in the far right corner from time to time. A tiny bit of curve to the panel would solve this but that is a bit of a pipe dream.

"I purchased this 50 inch tv for the lake because of the excellent reviews and price. We have been diehard Samsung purchasers up until now.

Set up takes 5 mins, easy to navigate (we are in our 60’s) need I say more?

"I have had this TV a couple of weeks now so I've had time to see how it fits into my life. First of all, I am a 77-year old woman living alone and I was able to set it up completely by myself. The directions were straight forward and easy to follow. The hardest part was putting the feet on because the screws were black and the insertion points were also black. The actual set up of the programming was amazingly easy. Most apps or features I wanted on the Home Screen could be set up using a QR code which then went to your account for features like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Apple TV and others. No complicated setup was required. I really appreciated that!

I love the Home Screen. At first I wasn't sure I'd like it but as I've used it I've come to love that it gives me all kinds of options as soon as I turn it on. I even set it up to give me weather in my area. If I want to go to Netflix or even Apple TV I just click on that option and I'm good to go. If I want to access the Home Screen of my satellite dish provider, I just click on HDMI1 and it takes me there.

There is also a feature that allows you to use Alexa to find things but I haven't done much with that yet. It sounds like it will be fun to explore though.

All in all, I had this TV unboxed, set up and ready to watch in less than an hour. That, to me, is success!",B09RRKX2KB,Samsung Quality,,5.0 out of 5 stars

"First thing one should appreciate, is the sheer size of the item. Massive at 65"". The box arrived by Amazon freight at 6:30 am, but it was worth it because I feared it would be left in lobby which is not secure.
The box is massive and quite tall.

Set up requires a minimum 2 able bodied people. The box pops open on the side with some light pressure and the TV is there for all to see. Picture quality is impressive and will show non-HD images well enough with very little pixelation. HD and 4K signals are crystal clear and dynamic.

The remote is easy to navigate and only a little intimidating at first. It is actually set up rather simple, but I can appreciate this. The options on the screen are numerous, but navigating is simple. Take from me a non-technical person on any level.

Connects easily to sound bar with minimal fuss. I got it for cable and movies, so I don't use the Wi-Fi and smart options. It may be a smart TV but I'm a dumb guy, so that's that.

I would recommend the product and the freight was spot on. Was concerned I'd get a tv with cracks or dead spots in screen. This was not the case, and I am grateful. The price point can't be beat, I know because I searched. Amazon has some of the best policies of any company so ordering from them is a no brainer.

"Never been a Hisense fan, but I am now. I’ve always solely purchased higher end Samsungs and Sony’s. But with funds tightening down these days I decided to save myself a grand and go with this TV. I’ve heard a lot of good feedback from TV enthusiasts on this particular model and I can confirm it’s pretty fantastic. Right out of the box the colors pop, GUI is zippy, and it’s just an attractive looking TV. I’m not a pixel peeper, but I rewatched all my favorite marvel movies for the first time in 4K and this TV delivered. Sound sucks, like on any TV, but it’s pretty standard practice to buy a soundbar or have a legit 5.1/7.1 setup these days so that can’t ever be a contributing factor for a lesser rating. You can see some negative reviews here, and that’s from some folks that don’t even own this model and just had a single bad experience with another Hisense model. Reality is some panels can be bad, from any brand. This is the best quality for the price imo. I’m still blown away I got it on sale here on Amazon for under a grand AND Hisense is going to give me $100 after 100 days as part of their promo just for keeping this TV. Yeah it’s a no brainer.",B0B7CQHWT8,Picture Perfect,,5.0 out of 5 stars
" Although it does not have all of the gaming stuff that is says and is the reason I bought it, it's still a huge upgrade from the TV I had. It has the dts and e-arc and a few other things, and it measures 54.8 inches across which is 4 inches bigger than my old high sense that markets itself as a 55"" and overall it has a way better picture quality so I ended up keeping it even though it didn't have all the though stuff it claims to have.

"This isn't blooming - it even appears when the entire scene is black (e.g., a transition between scenes in a movie). There's about a 30cm x 20cm ovular area just above center where there's significant bleed through from the back light (if my understanding of LED is correct, the back light shouldn't even be on in such a scenario). After dealing with boxing the whole damn thing back up, I'm just going to spend the money on an OLED.

One other thing that is almost a show stopper - despite the settings seeming to support it, you can't turn off the soap opera effect in apps installed on the TV (e.g., Netflix, Amazon, etc); only works with the HDMI ports.

Other unhappy Hisense customers indicate that Hisense TVs often last between 1 and 2 years. I think that while all TV brands have issues, Hisense has far more than problems in warranty, and just out of warranty, compared to their competitors.

"This 70-inch Samsung Tv so far (a few days) meets may expectations regarding its picture and (somehow) its sound quality. I spent considerable time on adjusting tv settings to meet my expectations and I have achieved my goal, for you can control/adjust basically all aspects of the Tv picture, motion, sound, etc. However, this TV remote/pilot is quite annoying. It has minimum options to control, and it is difficult to use in a dark room (its buttons are not lit). Also, the Tv software/program annoyingly wants you to go on the internet and purchase/join some networks/providers. For my, using the cable provider, Spectrum, it is unnecessary policy of the Samsung. In essence, every time you turn on this TV it start with the Samsung Tv Plus, with icons of all these Netfixes, Hulus, Amazons, etc, plus your provider. However, there is a way to disable this defaulted preference and start your TV with the picture of the location where you have been when turned off TV. After a two more weeks:
A problem with the so called ""pink screen"" developed. Basically, from time to time, when my TV was turned on it displayed just a pink screen with no picture nor any sound. I contacted a Samsung support which is overseas, of course. They made a record of my TV issue and accepted my photo of its pink screen. They said, it was due to the weak or disrupted/corrupted video signal, HDMI connection between the source and TV. However, upon plugin it in and out and in again, apparently, my HDMI cable was not causing this problem. After researching the internet I decided to call my Spectrum cable provider. To my surprise, the technician was quite familiar with this issue, and remotely tuned my cable box (HDR). Upon his tuning, my TV screen turned to have WAY better picture quality (!) and he promised me that the pink screen will never show on my screen again. So, now I have a way better picture, practically ideal quality. Also, I keep my fingers crossed that this pink screen will never pay me a visit. Also, I wonder, why this TV was not packed at its factory with a decent manual brochure clearly explaining all these issues to the clients.",B09V6YLNML,tv is not compatible for satellite tv operation,,5.0 out of 5 stars

Turns out that this Samsung is perfect in every way. Not one complaint.
You can stand one foot from the screen and see not one pixel. Yet relax in the couch 20 feet away and still a perfect picture with rich, vibrant colors. It's also quite smart, acting more like a PC with tons of options to adjust, control and see virtually anything streaming, on my spectrum cable, or online via the web.

"We've had this TV for about 1 month now and so far it's a pretty good TV. The images are sharp and vibrant, sound quality is what you'd expect of TV speakers- clear enough, gets loud enough.

One complaint on this is that some of the smart features are not excellent.

For example, on the remote, there are several buttons to open up Netflix/Prime/Disney+ etc. but there's no way to change where those buttons lead. So for someone like me, who uses Hulu more often than anything else, the only other direct option is to use the microphone, which frequently misunderstands me- as most voice activated things do. I also wish I could use the voice commands to go directly to one show (ie ""open X FIles on Hulu"" vs. ""Open Hulu""...*Opens Hulu*... *type in name of show/scroll*)

We even connected it to our Google Home, but even still, the voice commands are limited in what they can do and it's usually just faster to do it manually.

Still though, I really can't complain. it's pretty decent overall and once I start playing my shows, it's usually smooth sailing.",B09V6YLNML,Good TV so far,,5.0 out of 5 stars

"Excellent tv. It arrived really fast. WOW!!! Best picture, it is so LIVE! Set up was easy&fast. FYI I don't have cable service, just internet. The remote, I confess, takes a bit to get used to, but in two days I was good using it. And I already know that, It will take a while discovering new features and no matter how much I find out, I'll barely be scratching the surface of what one can get from this tv! Gee, there are so many features to explore. I can't get over it.
To stream all my movies I have an array of free movie sites and a ton of other sites one can subscribe to. I can also download any site if not already in the enormous list of movie channels. Samsung offers ""News Channels"" to keep you updated with the world daily news.
But you can always download TubiTv-for free movies and free ""Live News""-- it wasn't in the ""apps home list"", but I downloaded it. As well as I downloaded the ""BritBox"" I subscribe to. WOW! Watching ""Shetland"", ""Vera""or ""Midsomer Murders"" etc... on this tv is like have yourself going for a walk in the movie set of those British countryside scene. It's soooo live, the image pops out of the screen at you.
I can also go to the internet browser, (after connecting a keyboard to this tv) and shop, research, write emails or do my fiction book writing and save it all to my email ""drafts"" file.
Ah, you can also connect your phone to the tv and answer it when ringing if you use a wireless pair of ear pod (a Bluetooth I paid only $23+tx online, have owned it and gifted several throughout the last 3yrs), just as I use with my computer, no tv noise from lowd music or movies to the neighbors! I don't know what else can I ask for, we'll, I am still discovering new functions in this incredible tv! I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS TV!
So happy I got it, and for a senior like me on a low SS pension, the 5pmts installments from Amazon suit my budget perfectly, in fact, it made all possible to buy this tv and other things for my new housing studio apt I recently moved to!

"Woke up this morning at 7am and saw that package was sitting outside my front door in Florida, within one day of order placement. Amazing Amazon.

Excellent picture quality out of the box as well as the sound. For the PC, I set the picture to Warm2. Desktop will show up automatically every time I turn the TV on.

"The picture quality is phenomenal. I got this because it was the cheapest 2022 Samsung model I could find that could run the XBOX app (cloud gamining without using a physical xbox).
A hardcore gamer who plays competeitve first person shooters might want to go for a higher model...like the Q80B, because that has VRR and 120Hz). But for people who are just playing Final Fantasy, Assassin's Creed, and Minecraft this is just fine, because the difference are minimal to non competitive gamers. It would costs hundreds more for a smaller size of the higher level models.
The sound quality is good and I don't feel inclinded to get a soundbar. It's lightweight and thin, so I was able to set it up myself as a petite woman. It was easy to navigate the menus and setup everything. It auto detected all gaming devices I plugged into the HDMI ports and added the icons to the gaming center section. Customer service responds within seconds on the samsung site for any questions. My only complaint was the annoying bloatware Samsung TV app that auoplayed random TV episdodes everytime I turned the TV on. Easy fix, long press on it and select ""disable"".

"I’ve purchased several Samsung TV’s and I am very disappointed with this purchase.

I’ve had my TV 3 weeks and I’m returning.

Out of the box, the picture looked good, but had issues connecting my Apple TV 4K.

In short, I’ve replaced the Apple TV for a new one, replaced 3 HDMI cables and tried various ports.

Sometimes my Apple TV works, sometimes the image blinks on and off and sometimes the picture if full of static.

The remote sucks too.

UPDATE:

I had decided to return this TV. The night before my scheduled return I reset the TV. Once I completed the reset everything worked perfectly.

I cancelled my return and I’m very happy with my purchase. I’ve gotten used the the remote. It isn’t that bad.

"Replaced my 65"" OLED B7a from 2017 with a 77"" C2 and I've been running it for a week as of now. The picture quality after calibration has improved over the older model. I feel the black levels on this device are far far better than the B7a ever were, which BTW required a lot of ""tinkering"" to get to what the C2 did pretty much out of the box. My old OLED had no burn-in that I could see, even after 5 years of daily usage, but the older OLED panel was never as uniform in solid colors test as this panel is, not even when the B7a was new. Especially watching dark scenes now, there is no fixed pattern noise anymore.

The scene motion on this TV is better what the B7a has, which was already good, but it had issues with some stuttering under certain conditions. Obviously this TV is 120hz with a 5 year newer video processing unit, so it would be expected to be a good improvement.

The worst part for me during initial setup was figuring out the new WebOS UI. Coming from the older B7a WebOS, which had things in different places and required different steps to get things done was quite frustrating at first. I guess once you understand how it works its okay.

After setting the TV like I wanted, I then updated the firmware and after the firmware update things didn't work right, things like LG channels got stuck, couldn't click out of some popups, etc, so I had to perform a factory reset, and redo the whole setup again. The TV has been running well since. So be aware that if you perform a hardware reset, chances are you might have to do a factory reset and redo all the settings.

The remote internal accelerometer wasn't calibrated somehow when I first paired it, so the pointer kept always pulling to the left on the screen. To resolve this I had to shake the remote several times until it finally became accurate. The scroll wheel feels a bit too deep this time compared to the previous magic remote from the B7a, which was way too high... guess the next TV will be at the sweet spot! :)

IMO. For the price of this TV I would've liked some backlight on the remote too. I did miss not having a pause button on the remote like the B7a. Which was nice to pause shows without having to bring the menu and click on the pause screen button.

Connectivity for DLNA worked well, the NAS and other storage stuff in my LAN was detected fine after everything was setup correctly.

Mobile screen cast via Miracast, etc... worked well with all my phones/tablets that are capable of screen cast.

All the basic streaming services I've tried worked well too.

Audio from the default speakers is certainly okay for a TV, and it seems to have improved the spatial audio somehow over the older B7a. Still no match for a dedicated receiver/speakers setup, but if you don't have one, this TV alone will be a good start.

Privacy was and is still a concern for me with this TV. And let me say it loud and clear: Serving ads on a 2500 dollar TV feels quite a bit of an insult, TBF; b/c at that point why not just give the TV away for free? if you are going to soak the end user in ads, and sell their usage stats, etc at some good $$$?
I believe most of the tracking, etc can be disabled by going into the agreements and disabling all the options there. For most of the basic B7a level of functionality that I wanted I only had to agree with the two first terms, so voice and all other terms are not enabled, which still is a bit of a concern to trust if a company will honor a checkbox... Also, the remote seems to have a built-in microphone, so if you are super concerned about this thing eavesdropping then you can just take the batteries out of the remote, or use an universal remote but you lose the nice mouse-like pointer. The old B7a remote doesn't seem to offer full functionality with the C2, at least not the mouse pointer part.

Overall the TV was a step up from the B7a, both in size and picture quality. Only time will tell how the TV pans out in the end, but if the B7a was an indication, working well for 5 years, I think this TV should last at least the same amount of time.",B09RMHBXYX,Freezes and picture quality is not special.,,5.0 out of 5 stars
"First week impression: visually stunning with some annoying quirks as a computer monitor.

I purchased this to replace an aging Seiki SM40UNP. I use it exclusively as a computer monitor, both for work and gaming. Visually the LG is in a different league than the Seiki. Colors are more vivid, it's much brighter, and blacks are like a portal to the endless void. These differences were apparent before enabling HDR, and then HDR bumped up the colors and brightness even further. During HDR calibration I flinched and cursed to an empty room when it switched from black to white; it was blinding. For gaming this is good stuff. I played some games with native HDR and some games with Windows Auto HDR. I ended up disabling Auto HDR because I thought it made some games look over-saturated, but that's probably just personal preference. Native HDR looks great.

The same visual fidelity that's great for games is a little overwhelming when using the monitor as a workstation, particularly when reading black text on a white background. Even after cranking the SDR brightness in Windows down to its lowest level, I can feel eye strain starting after just an hour of reading text. Some people have suggested that this has more to do with Windows' HDR implementation than the monitor itself; I don't know. Whatever the cause, I prefer the drab presentation of the Seiki monitor for reading/editing text. I'm typing this review on an old LCD monitor because it's more comfortable than doing it on the LG.

OLED protection features are also a bit annoying at times. E.g. if the TV detects that the input it's showing is mostly unchanging, it will slowly dim the screen. Unfortunately, typing into a dark-themed text editor seems to count as ""mostly unchanging"". Every 10 minutes or so I need to grab a bright window and shake it to wake the monitor from its apparent stupor. It's like trying to keep a tired puppy awake. I disabled other features like logo dimming that seemed to be causing problems, so this whole-screen dimming is the only one that continues to irk me. I also voluntarily use a black wallpaper and configure the Windows taskbar to auto-hide to protect the panel from burn-in; make sure you know what you're getting into if you're going OLED for the first time.

The most significant weakness of this TV is that it is... well, a TV. It's a bad sign when you have to use a remote control to agree to a privacy policy before using a computer monitor. It's not plug-and-play, it's plug-and-read-reddit-thread-and-modify-dozens-of-settings-and-play. After spending a couple hours researching and fiddling with settings there are still some things I'm not happy with. For instance, the TV doesn't enter standby the way purpose-built computer monitors do. When the computer stops sending a signal the TV takes over and shows vibrant wallpapers for a while before turning off completely, such that you have to turn on the TV again separately from waking up the computer. Maybe there's a setting to change this - if there is, I may never find it.

The final quirk is a graininess most noticeable in uniform blocks of grayish colors, which unfortunately feature prominently in many dark-themed applications. It appears to be caused by slight variation in pixel color. The grain is visible at a viewing distance of 24 inches / 60 cm, but IMO it's only distracting if you're closer than 18 inches / 45 cm.",B09RMHBXYX,Sony 65 inch bravira olef,,3.0 out of 5 stars
"This 77” LG C2 OLED TV is absolutely breathtaking. This is the best picture quality I’ve personally ever seen and it actually exceeded my expectations. Of course you get stunning contrast, colors, and crisp 4K scenes, but I want to call out some lesser mentioned features that I’ve already come to love.

- Magic remote: the Nintendo WII style cursor that allows you to navigate all apps either through traditional remote buttons or via the aim and click method is great - providing a new way of doing things but allowing you to still use traditional buttons. Also allows for equipment control to control my Samsung sound bar.
- WebOS: unlike my older LG tv, now all my streaming apps are native to tv. I get to ditch the Fire tv cube for paramount plus and HBO max
- Alexa integration works nicely
- Game mode, presets like FPS, RPG etc make switching for each game super easy. Already this tv has given an upper edge in FPS games.
- Sound- for some reason all sound is crisper
- Airplay: iOS screen mirroring and airplay work great, as well as screen mirroring from my MacBook Pro. I didn’t realize this was a feature.

Only downside so far is the Picture in Picture / split screen not working (seen other reviewers having same experience). It would be great to be able to play a game and have Netflix in a PIP window. Hopefully future software updates will fix this.",B09RMHBXYX,Great,,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Where to start? Beautiful picture 4k and SD, outstanding sound, well thought out design. It's all that and more. However, a diagram of the inputs and outputs would be REAL handy, especially when trying to plug things in, And just what do you do with the little plastic pieces (finally found in the one page instruction sheet). And the same goes for the, what I assume to be, IR blasters? Since it is set up for the PC that gloriously melted down when I attached it to the monitor (I should point out that the Alienware died while the Pi 4 8GB and little NUC never had a problem with it), I can not say how it looks for gaming and will be moving it and taking photos of the port connections and label them in the photo for future reference. I also found it to be a royal pain to find anything on LG's website. I still haven't registered it because my model does not exist yet. I hate time paradoxes! Okay, fine let's look for any manuals. Oh. I see. searching support gives an article Google Stadia issues, and another that tries to sell me one. Not holding out hopes for any support, at least for a while. It really makes me wonder if the fire sale pricing is a way to get rid of stock...

In short, don't buy unless you are techy, geeky, or know someone who is, and treat then we because they will be your support for this beautiful monitor. I know I am ripping on it, but as I said earlier, it has a beautiful picture, outstanding sound, well thought out design (if they only documented it better).

"#1 son installed the TV following the directions provided, connecting the cable and Blu-ray player was simple. One remote included. Cable remotes can turn set on or off but can’t move through the menu, need the Lg remote for that and signing into apps.

Great bright picture from any angle, some older TV shows & movies automatically show in old formats that don’t fill the screen. Internet ready, but it has an app for the ones I use and no info on what else I could do with it.

This TV, like so many devices now, does not come with even a basic instruction booklet on how to use all the features, so stumbling your way around is required to set up your Disney+ or Netflix, or what the unmarked colored buttons are for, etc. For all I know it may cook my dinner but I’ll never find that feature!

I would love to tell you that this tv is great. It looks awesome at the Best Buy that i saw it at. But I will continue to have to wait to get my hands on this tv. Their attempt to deliver this tv failed on epic proportions. My wife and I were here waiting all day for this tv. I left my phone in the bedroom while I took a quick shower. They called my phone while I was in the shower and did not bother to knock on the door. They said no one was home and rescheduled the delivery. I called the number back 4 minutes after they called; for them to tell me there was no way to get a hold of the driver and I would have to reschedule. The delivery truck comes from somewhere in Houston TX and I live in college station tx which about 2-2.5 hours depending on traffic. They were in my drive way and because I didn’t answer my phone they are going to reschedule a delivery that it over a hundred miles away simply because they did not knock on the door. I do not see how any of this makes sense. However the tv is amazing. I love it the best tv I’ve ever watched or game on.,B09RMHBXYX,In our world of apples…..,,4.0 out of 5 stars

"Coming from a Acer Predator 34 inch curved monitor, the size increase of this monitor isn't a shock. The width is similar, but there is more vertical height for sure. I will say that for a monitor sitting on a desk, 42 inches is about the limit for me. Any larger and you are turning your head too much.

I also recommend a monitor arm so you can move this around easily. So often in the past I have done without it and once you get an arm, you wont want to deal with something sitting on your desk. Especially a 42 inch monitor or tv.

It's a great OLED display with plenty of brightness. It supports G-Sync / FreeSync and variable refresh rate (VRR) @ 120hz. It has inky blacks as all good OLED screens do. The auto white balance is not too annoying for PC use in my opinion.

Since its a 4k screen, I do organize windows in all 4 corners of the display for work and I am sure that we will see a small amount of image retention eventually. Time will tell. I haven't turned off any of the self protecting features of the TV and don't plan to. Nothing annoying to report as a result. There is also a pixel cleaning feature that runs as needed already if this works similar to C1 models.

It really is one of the best displays I have ever used both in terms of color, black levels, response time, and clarity. Hard to beat and in many cases an equivalent LCD monitor that is anywhere near this in quality would cost much much more.",B09RMHBXYX,"Great picture, no reflections, looks good, EZ setup",,5.0 out of 5 stars

"8/14/22 update: LG got the parts out fairly quickly and a local electronics company did the repair in less than an hour. They replaced the screen, not a board.

I reiterate that the TV itself is a 5 — it’s got a fantastic picture and I have 30+ years of broadcast TV production experience so I know what I’m talking about.

But I’m only updating my rating to 4/5 instead of 5/5 because of LG’s service process.

When I opened the original repair ticket, LG automatically provided troubleshooting recommendations. I had already followed the instructions that are available online and told them so. However, there’s no ability to attach a picture to the ticket and they automatically close the original ticket and then ask you to open a new ticket with all of the same information that was provided previously in case troubleshooting doesn’t fix the problem.

Once the second ticket was entered LG eventually asked for a picture but then they didn’t make it available to the repair facility so they asked for a picture as well.

Start to finish, time to repair completion was about a week and the TV was not completely down during this time. But I think LG’s repair ticket workflow needs some tweaks

Original review:
Would have rated this 5 stars as it's a fantastic TV but yesterday a thin line developed top to bottom about 1/3 of the way in from the right edge. Have contacted LG for repair and will update my review based on the repair experience.",B09RMHBXYX,50/50,,3.0 out of 5 stars

"This is my second LG and third led flat screen. The screen here is incredibly thin (at least at the top) and the whole unit was much lighter than my previous 65 inch. That made it easy to mount by myself. The picture is beautiful and because I have shades on all the windows of my TV room the brightness is more than adequate (knew OLEDs can have a brightness problem but this model--and the next higher--have been reviewed as quite good in the brightness area.) Because I had an LG previously, I am quite familiar with the controls and the options although the OS in much updated from my previous unit, but that is part of why I bought new. Now I can do any and all streaming directly from the TV without needing to go through my cable service and/or a Fire cube as I was doing. It is also very convenient that the TV controls the on/off of the new AV receiver I also just bought (down to only two remotes!). The only difficulty I had in getting everything setup was to get the lip sync correct which ended up requiring that I bypass any corrections from both the TV and Receiver.

"Short and sweet, everything works as expected and advertised. The picture quality is superb, and I haven't felt the need to do a lot of tweaking, much less calibration, to get it there (as I have in the past on other TV's). The overall look of the TV is very minimalistic, as the edge of the screen and the stand nearly disappear. Speaking of the stand, it's very stable while being low profile, and the multiple installation methods to modify the height, while I haven't needed them, are a useful feature that I'm sure many will appreciate. I can't speak to the internal speakers as I don't use them, but I can say the arc features work very well and very seamlessly. I can just turn on the Apple TV, and the TV and reciever both turn on and move to their correct inputs. Likewise, I can turn on the TV, and the same adjustments are made. I find I seldom need to adjust the TV or receiver. Just turn on the source and go. I've had issues with other TV's where arc either didn't do all I needed or at times, was fighting what I was trying to do. None of that with this TV. It does what you expect and need from arc pretty flawlessly.

Now for all of the look and features, this TV is all about the picture, and it is awesome! I'm sure a tester could find some tiny flaw somewhere, but as a normal user with pretty big expectations, it delivers. I think you'd have to be looking for something to ding this TV on when it comes to picture quality, and even then, you'd probably need a pointer in the right direction to find it still. I'm sure there are likes and dislikes to be had on the smart tv features and the OS, but it's the picture that matters the most, and on that count, this Sony truly delivers! Oh, and set your Apple TV to use Dolby Vision and..... just wow!

If you wonder about the true blacks of OLED, it's mostly what you don't notice that is the real story. None of the blooming or banding in dark scenes. Every once in a while, the depth of the black will pop out and make you notice, but most of the time, it's more subtle and, like everything with the picture quality on this TV, just ""right"". Nothing is drawing your attention so much as it all just looks natural and right, so your brain just moves on without notice.

I can't say this is the best ""deal"" for a TV, or even for an OLED (I haven't tried them all to say the least). What I can say is the picture is spectacular, and I don't think you'll be at all disappointed.",B09R9JPSTH,solar power clicker does not work!!!,,4.0 out of 5 stars

The top right side has a small ripple in the frame and a dimple in the screen. Let me tell you when we realized this it gave us a panic. We don't want to return it and will de with the minor damage. I'm waiting to hear back from customer service to see if they offer any solutions. Other than that the TV is amazing. The smart features respond to the remote quickly and they're many apps to use.

"My main comment is on the VESA-compliant mounting screw capability on back of the TV for compatibility with standard mounting brackets. I only wished to hang my TV like a big picture within a wall nook especially recessed for 55"" TVs. Using two plain old M6 x 1"" bolts do the job just fine into the back of the set, along with some steel or copper wire cabling between them. The set only weighs 35 pounds or so. Takes 2 people to hang on the wall hangars, which can be 1"" fender washers on sturdy wood lag screws for certainty it won't ever slip off. If you don't need to swing your set out and pivot it around, there's no need to spend $100-300 on a fancy ""flush-mount"" bracket that does that. I wish Sony packed something other then 2 short M6 screws only, without any cabling or simpler wall mount option.",B09R9JPSTH,Good,,5.0 out of 5 stars

"The picture quality is excelent; definitly hard to beat oled. I watched the original 1973 Westworld movie and the TV made it look great (too bad it couldn't improve plot). I've had problems with the OS where apps stop working requiring some combination of deleting the app data and/or restarting the TV; very frustrating. This has already happened a few times in less than a week. Roku TVs have been much more reliable. Hopefully a future OTA firmware update will help. I may just install a Roku if problems continue; sorry Sony/Google.

Update 8-1-2022: Dropping to 4⭐ due to buggy OS. Wired network stopped working today... restarted TV and it's working again. Basicaly theres been something every few days that requires the TV to be restarted via the system menu to fix.

Update 8-19-2022: Things are better after last firmware update. Leaving at 4⭐ because the OS should be easier to use and I don't have a lot of confidence in it not having another bug in a later update. At least I'm still happy with the picture.

Update 9-30-2022: TV has only required one restart to fix network issue. It's hard wired so I'm blaming the OS; everything else in the house was working. The TV interface continues to disappoint due to the number of clicks to do anything. I'm also getting tired of seeing all of recomended shows to watch served up from google. Plugging in a Roku is still an option.

"Update: I believe I have identified the main issue affecting my tv. The TV's wifi receiver seems to disable when the TV goes into a deep sleep mode.

For now, this TV is unusable. Different variations of the software crashing -- freezing on the home screen, remote/power button ceasing operation, tv failing to initiate from power on, etc. This is happening multiple times a day. The solution is to hard reset--unplug the tv, press the tv power button, wait 2 minutes, and then plug back in.

"Simple as this. I love the picture of the tv, best I have ever seen. Games are almost 3d when played at night on ps5... BUT. I am an audiophile that has dumped 20k in my home theatre. My receiver is not the current HDMI standard as ps5 or t.v. so I had to hook the ps5 up to tv 1st via hdmi 4 then using tvs earc port to send sound to my receiver via earc. Here is where the problems start every time I launch or close an application my receivers input changes to an HDMI port that is not in use... Than i have to change back to the designated ps5 input.. If if I touch tv remote to change tv setting, again receiver input changes to a not fin use hdmi port.. My receiver has not autochange input functionality and had never done this before. If I remove earc the problem stops. Also when i turn on my ps4pro with connected psvr. It changes and creates an input on receiver name named psvr, i then again have to change back to proper input on my receiver to get sound which is labeled pspro... I have talked to level 2 techs at yamaha and they have been great. The issue is not the receiver it is a bravia sync issue... When i call sony they just say not there issue... When you drop this much money on a tv and have the technical know how that is a BS answer based on audio bugs and Sony customer service I give the tv 2 stars and will purchase an LG next time",B09R9JPSTH,Nice TV for the price and very fast delivery.,,5.0 out of 5 stars
"EDIT: It's been two months and the tv has begun freezing. I have to unplug it to hard restart. Very disappointed - total waste of a lot of money. Don't do it.

I aspired to get this particular television for years. Literally years. It's widely known to be the best television available in a normal marketplace, but it's so expensive. I finally treated myself, and here I am a few months later unsure if it was worth it. I've never seen a better picture. It's true that the blacks are true blacks (no more gray splotches), and when I'm watching 4K videos it's wild how realistic it seems - almost like you're there. The sound is good too compared to my other television. This one has bass and richness.

That being said, I find most of the features to be unnecessary and maybe even confusing. The setup took half an hour, and I don't even remember all the functions it said it had. Sometimes it doesn't connect to the wifi immediately. It takes a few steps to do simple things like change the brightness. It's not super thin. And it's soooo expensive.

"Overall very happy with purchase.

Picture frame mode: looks fantastic, especially after adding a Samsung frame (purchased separately and shown in the pictures.) Paintings look absolutely real even up close. The brush strokes are so real looking! My only complaint is that the backlighting doesn’t adjust automatically based on the room lighting like it does when in TV mode. So as the sun sets the picture starts to look back lit giving away the illusion. It is possible to lower the backlighting with the remote to fix that, but it has to be done manually. Then the next day it’s too dark until you adjust it back up again. Would be perfect if it auto adjusted like it does in tv mode, but it doesn’t. Note that tv mode lighting is completely separate from frame mode lighting, which is good because the frame needs to be lower brightness when in frame mode to look like a real painting.

Tv mode: the picture quality with 4K looks better than my older Samsung 4K tv. Because of the matte finish there is zero glare where it had some glare on my old tv in the same spot. The Samsung software is harder to use than on my old Samsung tv but manageable. Some settings are difficult to find, and if a cable gets unplugged, you have to re-teach it what you have. It seems to lose settings easy when things get unplugged and doesn’t find them automatically again as my other Samsung tv does.

White Solar remote: so the solar feature simply does not work. Even leaving it in full sun for several hours makes no difference. Many other folks report this problem too. Thankfully you can charge it with a usb c connector (not provided) if you have one. I am able to get the remote to control my tv, surround sound via Denon receiver, my Xfinity cable box and my AppleTV device. So it’s great to be using one remote for everything. However, because the remote has so few buttons, it can take a series of 5 or 6 presses to get to certain menus on my cable box dvr (like to see my recorded shows). It’s doable but difficult. There just isn’t a good simple option for quickly getting to some cable tv menus.

Overall a great product if not a bit on the expensive side. If you can live with the software flaws, you will be happy with the end result. Who knows, perhaps a software update in the future could make them better. I still recommend this TV.",B09TQ4KFCT,Excellent picture,,4.0 out of 5 stars

We wanted to mount in a location where both plates fell in between the studs, and had no option to secure them to the wall. I had to open the wall to install reinforcement. It would be nice if it came with one long mounting plate, like other mounting systems. The one connect box is bulky, it needs to have a big recess behind the tv to hide it.

"Overall, this is an impressive device and I'm happy with my purchase.

The anti-reflective coating is truly unique among all screens I've ever seen, and this was my major reason for purchasing it. I can have all the lights on in the room with bright, direct sun coming through big windows. There won't be a single reflection anywhere on the screen. I've never seen a screen do anything like this.

The result is that art (especially paintings) look like they're on a canvas. Several guests have not been able to tell it was a TV when in art mode. High-resolution photographs on the other hand look almost ""hyper-real"", because no canvas print could ever match the resolution achieved on the screen. The result is always beautiful.

The viewing experience as a TV is also comfortable and enjoyable *during* the viewing.

My major complaint is that the software is clunky. It is a slow process to upload images to the TV. It took a while to figure out how to crop images correctly (as 16:9) to remove the mat, and there was no help for this in the app. The TV itself supports all the usual apps, and so the experience within the apps is reasonable, but the navigation between them is clunky as well. You also can't seem to use pure voice control (via Bixby) unless you also buy a *Samsung* soundbar!

The good news is that you spend most of your time watching the TV or viewing art rather than using the interface, so in practice, it's just an annoyance. Still, it's frustrating that Samsung hasn't paid more attention to the user interface experience, and if they ever do with an update, I'll be changing this to 5 stars.",B09TQ4KFCT,"Good Picture, Great Access to Internet Channels",,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The picture is excellent. The wall mount is amazing. The art display mode is great. The sound is surprisingly good. The compatibility with PC / Apple products is great, including screen share from PC and airplay from the phone.

The auto-on/off needs to be better. After using this a couple of weeks, I still don't know how the WiFi on-off works, my guess is that it is tracking the smartthings app on my phone, but my phone is normally in lock mode, so it doesn't get the signal and thus turns the screen off (this even seems to happen right after I push the power button to turn it on ... it just turns off again right away). This is pretty annoying. It would be much better to have a motion sensor in the TV that just turned after some time of no motion. So, I ended up just turning this feature off and using the basic timeouts.

The art content is pretty limited. If they had screens like microsoft login screens, it would be really worth it. There are a few famous paintings, but most of the art is of the same style, which is not to my taste. So, I use mostly my own pictures / art. Annoyingly, they put your favorites and personal imported art all the way at the bottom, so you have to scroll through all the other stuff to get to what you want.

The upload options are pretty limited and not very good. It seems to auto-widen any picture you have to the full width. So, to work around this, you have to put them in photoshop and make a fake picture the size of the screen to get it to show up correctly on the Frame. They only have two options for the mat, unlike the options with the purchased art. Last, it seems to only allow one group for your own art / pictures. It would be much better to have multiple lists so you have different types of art depending on your mood (e.g. a beach theme, an impressionist theme, etc).

I would definitely buy this, but these improvements would make it much better.

All was great until I watched Last of the Mohicans. Any dark scenes (of which there are many) showed several cloudy white spots on the screen. Not very bright but instantly noticeable. I tried watching other movies and other sources to make sure the issue remained, and it did. Showed up just the same in the intro to Jurassic Park. Changed settings on the picture to make sure it wasn't a setting issue, still had the problem. The cloudy white patches are randomly placed, too, and do not move.

So, I ordered a replacement TV. New TV came, and guess what? Same issue, and this time there were more white spots and in different areas. Again, reconfirmed with multiple sources, shut off all lights in the room to make sure it wasn't a reflection issue, but sure enough, they are there and I can't get rid of them.

Now I wonder how wide spread the issue is and if Samsung is aware? Returning a massive TV like this is a hassle, I don't really want to try again through Amazon since I've had the same result twice. Anyone else notice this? I guess next step is to contact Samsung customer service. Will update if there is a solution.",B09TQ4KFCT,Great TV,,5.0 out of 5 stars

"I have a 1150sft 2 bedroom condo and purchased 3 Frame TVs to cover both bedrooms and the living room. Each looks great but the remote control situation is very annoying. Each remote controls each TV so turning off one often turns on another or trying to turn on one and you turn on two. I spend too much time correcting which TV should be on or off. Plus the remote doesn’t work consistently, I think it’s because of the solar power not being charged. I contacted Samsung and was told there is no way to restrict the remote to one TV.",B09TQ4KFCT,Love the picture!,,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Mediocre TV by itself - prepare to watch the spinning circle for apps (HULU, Netflix, HBO etc.). I have the box next to an EERO with Comcast’s fastest internet and still only manage a couple bars. Several times a week I need to rescan for the same WiFi to hopefully get a chance to watch a show without interruption. It’s a royal pain when you only have limited time to watch TV.

I love the tv but had to purchase a battery operated remote because the solar power remote does not work unless you plug it in to an outlet…and even then it only lasts a day before you have to recharge it. It’s basically always dead.,B09TQ4KFCT,Great TV for the price,,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I genuinely enjoy this TV, and even in a world where you can get 120hz 4K sets for half this price, I was happy with my purchase—no buyer’s remorse (unlike the hard to swallow feeling of paying $100+ for the flimsy plastic bezel accessory which should be included for free).

The matte screen is simply a joy to the eye. Glare is virtually nonexistent. Fill your room with beautiful natural daylight, and you still get to enjoy gaming and viewing. You don’t have to compromise your room for the sake of the TV or vice versa. You don’t need a man cave.

I avoid smart TVs in general because they’re just not smart enough to be worth the hassle. The OS is usually slow, and the menus are clunky and unintuitive. This is no exception. I still would have given it a 5-star rating. That’s how much better this panel is—it improves your quality of life. Go ahead, enjoy Underworld at 19:00 instead of having to wait until the sun goes down.

The 2-star rating is for the awful tape residue/stain left by the utterly useless pieces of tape placed directly on the panel. When you unbox the TV, there will be the standard bezel wrap, which includes the Energy Star label. Unfortunately there is a larger type of tape that seems to be holding and protecting nothing at all. The adhesive from this tape seems to penetrate or bond to the screen and leave a stain that is visibly distracting whenever it is dark or off.

The official Samsung support answer is to wipe it away with distilled water and a soft microfiber. I assume this is to avoid damaging the screen with added minerals or harsh textures. Got my 500 gsm microfiber from The Rag Company, basically the softest and best, and I ordered some distilled water. No change. Now maybe I’m a noob who should just buy some screen cleaner, but I’m not risking my $1400+ investment to some unknown formula, especially when the manufacturer carries my warranty and did not authorize it. I refuse to be responsible for correcting an issue right out of the box.

I didn’t even 1-star it because I would honestly take this defect over a flawless standard TV. I fully expect matte screens to replace the glossy mirrors we used to call televisions. Yes monitors exist, but the larger sizes are more common for commercial or gaming applications and cost much more per inch. This is where it’s at. The manufacturers just need to avoid whatever tape is being placed on the panel.

Amazon was kind enough to send me a replacement, and it had the same tape and stain. Sending it back. Not an isolated incident. Sad because I just can’t go back to gloss now. My old TV is so reflective I’d rather just have nothing. I guess I’ll read books?",B09TQ4KFCT,Good value for the price,,4.0 out of 5 stars

"Hi - loved what I'd seen of the Frame options before this, and so signed up imediately for the pre-release when I learned about the anti-glare option coming in 2022. I love the bezel (very narrow), the anti-glare LOOKS like it should work great (we have a lot of huge windows in our room, so that was key). it's very thin, seems well made, great custom frame finishes, was well packaged, came fairly quickly, and wasn't too pricey. So - what's not to like ? Well, the whole idea behind paying the extra coin for this model is so that it'll look clean (like a picture on the wall) - yes ? Unfortunately, whoever designed the OneConnect module clearly never used the set. You CANNOT put it inside the wall, either behind or below the panel (it has needed connection ports on 2 perpendicular faces of the box - WHO is the i-dot who thought that could work ? It only comes with a short connection cable even if you DO decide to mount it externally outside the wall (and then it looks dopey since it is ungainly, and VERY poorly thought out needing cables to exit ifrom two perpendicular sides - insane). Want a longer connect cable ? No problem - just pay a ton more for an aftermarket version :-( We hired the top professional in Denver to attempt to dress it all up and make it work. He came over, listened to what we wanted thinking it'd be no problem...looked at what was here...thought and played around for a while...then promptly refunded all of our $ (even the trip charge) telling us that - in his opinion - no matter what he could think of, it was never going to look ""clean"" :-( Another trifling item - WHO is the clown who thought that a storm-trooper white remote control was a good design idea (for something which folks routinely need to pickup and manipulate with their hands) ? Just a gross, fingerprint-showing nightmare to constantly be cleaning, and yet another example of this product NOT having been tested even a little by folks who actually USED it :-o Add in the fact that you can see the electrostatic emitter behind the screen due to the charge massively grabbing dust out of the air around the set (despite having 2 brand new air filters which we installed to scrub the air in an effort to eliminate that issue), as well as the problems referenced in other reviews with displaying your own pics and Samsung trying to make extra bucks selling you online art; and you have just a recipe for a very vexing, disappointing product :-( We WANTED so badly to really like this - it just seems strongly like it wasnt' really ever tested by anyone who actually USED the product for more than an hour or two or in their own home. Overall, I'd have to say - it isn't the WORST...but wait another generation or two until Samsung (who is normally awesome) to actually issue a product with the kinks worked out that is ready for consumer use. As it is - it's WAY better in a store setting than anything you'll actually put onto your wall at home. Just my thoughts - but I did waste a ton of effort and time trying to make it work :-o",B09TQ4KFCT,Over all quality and price,,5.0 out of 5 stars

"1) You can't upload photos wirelessly without going through the online server... Which is down frequently... I mean, a lot... So, if you want to do that last min surprise pic for your family at the TV, good luck
2) Regular pics (even high resolution) need some sort of treatment to look like the pics on the screen you might have seen in the shop... Samsung offers no tool to support you to make it sharp... The number of proper pics available without purchase is ridiculous... IT'S A $2K TV!!!
3) Some TVs come with bezel, some not... For the same price... Guess which I bought because I did not read the fine print last month?
4) Smart features such as movement sensor are not clearly explained... Yet to figure how that works

"As you can see from the picture, the FIRST TV I was sent was not an acceptable product. And honestly, I believe they sent this shattered screen one on purpose because I called & complained about a delivery hold up, so I believe they just grabbed a broken one & threw it on the truck because I suddenly & very quickly got it like the next day, strangely enough. Even more strange was that the two capable gentlemen who delivered this one had it strapped securely to the inside rear of the truck with absolutely nothing around it (in an empty 10ft radius) that could've damaged it so badly & they were not reckless or dropsy, so I'm still not sure how a TV shipped & handled that securely got shattered across the entire front of the screen while being handled by such careful pros. Thankfully the replacement was much better and I received a free, ""DELUXE DELIVERY & UNBOX"" which was a very misleading thing because when they got here w/ the TV, the young gentleman in charge continually explained how they could do nothing but take it out of the box, plug it in and ensure operation, which amounted to making sure it turned on, and then take the box and leave. That's it, that's all! They literally wouldn't even help me lift it onto the table where it was to sit. I still don't know what was ""DELUXE"" about this Deluxe Delivery & Unbox. Oh, & the same guy complaining about all they couldn't do for me instead of focusing on what he could do? He also had to (quite annoyingly) repeatedly tell me that they weren't even ""supposed to deliver to you because of the construction"" going on in what used to be our apt bldg's parking lot. Yet Amazon delivers here practically everyday. But for some strange reason he was insistent that the construction out front was a definite No No for Amazon deliveries (or maybe he meant just for TV deliveries). I'm stil not sure. Either way, still makes no sense.
So now to the TV. I ordered this 65"" Samsung Crystal Tizen for TWO MAIN REASONS.
1) It had a voice remote & 3 voice assistants to choose from, but since I like Google & they were pushing this as a Google TV w/ Google Assistant, that was a big selling point for me. Actually the biggest selling point. I knew I could very easily connect my already established Google Assistant like I had done on a 4K Chromecast I bought from Walmart in 2020. But sadly, THAT NEVER HAPPENED! After speaking extensively to Samsung TV support, Google & Google Assistant support, Amazon support, & even some support chat bots & emails & community support forums & you name it, I tried it. The best advice I got to simply move forward from this nightmare fiasco was to go ahead & just use one of the other two remaining voice assistants that were still available on the TV, Samsung's Bixby, or Amazon's Alexa. Both of which I dislike. What I had seen of Samsung's Bixby from interaction with it on my Samsung Galaxy phones and tablets was that it was fully advertisement saturated, and I dislike that immensely. Whereas Amazon's Alexa is just one big speaking algorithm designed primarily for nothing more than selling more Amazon merchandise. I don't need that on my TV remote & I'm also not buying another device to connect to it just to get it to work properly with the TV. Because of course if you select Alexa as your voice assistant they immediately try to upsell you into an Echo or some other unnecessary thing you don't need to operate a voice assistant on your TV remote. I've been using Roku voice remotes for 3 or 4 yrs now & they work just fine w/ their system as is. No extra device purchase necessary. My Google Chromecast works amazingly well with its Google Assistant voice remote. Both of those items were less than $100 each. Buuuut, a brand new 65"" 4K Samsung Crystal Tizen has the WORST voice assistant remote I've ever encountered. And it WILL NOT HOOK UP TO GOOGLE ASSISTANT. So, on to the . . . .
2nd REASON I PURCHASED THIS TV?
Because it had 4K UPSCALING!!! What a huge feature in a TV this inexpensive! I'd purchased a Sony Blu-ray player w/ 4K upscaling and it was amazing. I fell in love with how old DVD movies were brought up to nearly 4K quality with doing nothing more than putting the movie in the carriage and pushing play. So when I saw that this Samsung Crystal Tizen had 4K upscaling in all picture viewing formats, BOOM, I was all in. That 4K upscaling & the 4K picture clarity in it's Dynamic viewing mode have been the ONLY redeeming qualities in this entire fiasco of a purchase.
Talk about a bunch of ridiculous false advertising, pitiful customer support & delivery inadequacies, & more difficulty & flawed merchandise than one person should have to endure in an entire year? But of course these are all avoidable issues that I somehow created on my own when I clicked, ""Add to cart"" & made a purchase, fully believing & trusting that i was going to receive what i had read & saw with my own eyes, in the time i was told I'd receive it.
(Speaking of, did I mention the reason I called and complained about the delayed shipping to begin with was that my item, the broken TV in the picture, had been sitting in a little suburb about 20 minutes outside of town for going on 2 days and had not moved according to the tracking details? Which is why i believe when I called to inquire about it, that is what they sent me. Nearly 2 days in one spot 20 mins away from me? What would you do?)
Oh, & apparently I'll never have Google Assistant on this TV. It just won't connect. Keeps telling me to login & connect but won't let me. I've been FORCED to use Samsung's Bixby as the voice assistant for the TV & remote. UGGGHHHHH!!!
IN CLOSING - ITS A GOOD TV FOR THIS PRICE, BUT IF THEY RAISE THE PRICE? LOOK ELSEWHERE. AND REMEMBER, THE ONE FEATURE YOU'RE PERSONALLY AFTER? THE ONE FEATURE THAT MAY BE THE SELLING POINT THAT SOLD YOU ON THIS TV? IT'S HIGHLY POSSIBLE IT MAY NOT WORK OR WORK CORRECTLY. It's also a very high possibility that if you run into shipping and delivery issues, you can end up with a broken TV and have to do a long & painstaking, time consuming, long time waiting for your money back, refund and return.

"I am finding many,many features to adjust and turn on or off to control every day. The speakers are OK for normal sound and an EQ can be enabled. I bought 2 Bluetooth 5.0 headsets from SoundCore and noticed some inputs had that Bluetooth sound sync mismatch showing lips moving too late or early. I read about AptX LL (low latency) enabled TV and Headsets required for Video use with syncing sound with video. The sync off because I FF or RW streaming bit too much ...with non AptX phones I feared I had to buy 2 new headphones but it went away by it self. HDMI input #2 has the advanced type HDMI plug. I used that for my Xfinity Arris 4K cable box with a DVR HDrive or SSD. You need the small new XG1v4 DVR/cable box to output 4K to TV from them or they can send the tiny non-DVR one to go with normal HD box that does cloud only 4K. The only problem is the XG1v4 4K DVR cannot be controlled by the small Universal Remote provided currently. I tried the 20 attempts many times and even chose Arris as the manufacturer and the model #AX014ANM and the XG1v4 name and nothing works yet like on the other Xfinity boxes I had for a while. It says make sure your cable box is set for IR infrared to work but the cable box is fixed RF radio frequency only not dual type. Too bad the Remote is not dual output. Have to have 2 remotes.

"Delivery was fine, I guess. It was a “drop and run” situation - last time we ordered a TV from Amazon delivery was via a private company that actually unpacked it and plugged it in. This was delivered by Amazon and it was left on our porch with no knock or doorbell ring.

This TV Arrived with damage to the box and the back of the TV crushed. Miraculously the TV worked but we still returned because we were concerned that the the back would give out when mounted.

They picked up 5 days after delivery and it was picked up 6 days ago - not sure how long it would take to get back to Amazon to credit my card. We are still waiting as it says return started but there is no confirmation of pickup or any easy way to track it online since it’s a private 3rd party company which is concerning. That experience will determine if we order a replacement via Amazon or Costco.

The picture was good, set up easy through Samsung app that we had to download. The remote is weird/wonky and the interface is kind of clunky. I don’t love that.

The remote has no input button so have to navigate via the fire home screen which is pretty annoying. After first use, there’s a stacked panes button remote that’s for recent favorites and does in a way act as an input button. Tv doesn’t remember which input you leave on and boots to fire Home Screen every time. Couple more button presses in the morning I guess.

Screen is more than bright enough for desk work, I actually turned down brightness as I’m sitting about 2.5 ft away. Tv doesn’t do 4:4:4 chroma so text is not perfect but perfectly serviceable after a few tweaks; setting picture mode to pc and turning on super resolution seems to do the trick for now. Most general office work has black text against white in excel, outlook, teams, etc. don’t expect it to give me trouble reading wise but am aware it wouldn’t be the best monitor for detailed graphics nor critical PowerPoint where accurate colors are required. Attaching pictures of general office work and rtings chroma test: most are perfectly legible except the lowest two rows where there is some blur but legible, I don’t expect to read text in those color schemes for general office work.

A few surprises, this is actually natively airplay compatible and HomeKit. Airplay is always nice to have for a quick screen share from phone and HomeKit integration means I have a spare remote on my phone and it helps with the input button annoyance.

There is a slight window pane effect sitting this close, the utmost outer edge where the scroll bar would sit for many applications has an odd 3D effect, like it’s floating. Looks a little funny but not a show stopper.

Love the screen productivity this affords, it’s literally 4 x 21.5” at 1080p each, and with quick windows shortcuts (win+left+up, etc) it’s really easy to snap windows into a 4 grid to multitask or cross reference data.

Or it can offer massive screen real estate for spreadsheets and multiple word pages.

Now let’s hope it lasts.

Update***
While screen sharpness and text was not an issue, after a full day of work decided to return, the input lag was disruptive. Would have been fine for general home theater pc use but the typing lag was not conducive for work where I’m constantly firing off emails and messages. The tcl 4 series is much better in this regard and what ive ordered instead now.",B09ZLSRXRN,Loving it so far!,,
"Got this TV yesterday and it's great! Very snappy User Interface and Excellent picture quality all at a great price!

Standard is dull
Movie is too gray
Dynamic is too bright
Natural is too soft

You absolutely have to use the custom setting. To do so, open up an app and start watching a video. Then long press the home button on your remote. A side menu will reveal itself and scroll down to Picture.

Once you sign in with your Amazon account it basically just sets itself up. Picking it up from Best Buy was just as easy. Just show them your Amazon order number and they bring it right out to you. Honestly I wasn't expecting this great of picture quality from a TV under $300. I was pleasantly surprised. Will use this brand for some additional TV's we plan to put in the house.,B09ZLSRXRN,Great TV for my bedroom,,
"I use it for computer monitor, and the text is very sharp. You have an option of changing the type to PC.
I also use the computer to calibrate the text.
Other than that, some very minor negative:

1. It updates twice, meaning it can't get the latest and update. This is very minor.
2. It shows 4k youtube video in very good pictures, however, on some other video, the color is a bit off. It is very similar to when I compare Samsung $900 TV with $1700 TV. For $200 level monitor, it's a great deal.
3. The edges, when viewing close as a monitor, it reflects into the screen, and actually override the screen's edge, such as the scrollbar. This is a bit bigger issue. However, for $200 and very clear text, I would buy it again. Actually, I did, I bought one for my wife, then get another for myself.
4. The size is about perfect for monitor. The one it replaces is 48"", and I find myself having to move a bit left and right. When they make it curved (at low price), 48"" is probably fine.
5. This is not for game, at 4k, it works at 30 framerate, probably due to my computer, not the monitor, but it appears to support up to 60 frame per seconds. Still not for game, but not bad at all.

6. It has problem display some text not clearly, as black text in pink background, as seen in the attached picture. It is rare for many people to have this combination, but it's a minor problem anyway.

I would recommend this.",B09ZLSRXRN,This is a really impressive value priced Hisense 55 inch 4K ULED Smart TV,,

"It's a great TV for the price! I love having alllll of my streaming services available in my home theater system now! But my one criticism is that the picture just isn't that great in very dark scenes in TV shows and movies. Maybe there is a way to adjust the picture to fix this, but I haven't found it yet. If I could fix that, I'd give it 5 stars across the board.",B09ZLSRXRN,Vast Improvement,,

"You're here because you want a cheap TV. That's it. It's a TV that does TV stuff and it doesn't cost a lot. The picture is fine. You know you're getting trade offs for the price, so here's what they are:

-The speakers suck. They just do. Plan to be okay with that or get a soundbar.
-The built in smart stuff is probably fine for most people, but I prefer Apple TV. I don't even have this thing connected to wifi because I don't want Amazon tracking everything I do (""he says, as he writes this review on Amazon..."") but I'm sure Best Buy is getting a kickback for the usage of Fire TV (Insignia is a Best Buy house brand, if you didn't know).
-Because I don't use the built in smart stuff, it complains every time I turn it on that it's not connected to Wifi or Amazon. I use HDMI-CEC to control it through the Apple TV though, so I only see this message for a few seconds before it switches over. Annoying, but that's it.
-It's a little bulkier than a nicer TV would be, but again...you probably aren't here because you expect the slimness of an LG C1 on a $300 set.
-The design of the legs make it look like something I 3D printed. Maybe that's just a me thing, though.",B09ZLSRXRN,"Picture seems fine, not a fan of the audio",,

Now for the bad, I don't like that every time I turn it on it comes up to the home screen instead of coming on to the last channel it was on when I turned it off. I'm a cord cutter and most of my TV viewing is over the air via antenna, requiring me to change input from the home screen every time I turn it on. Also after having this TV for 3 weeks it has totally locked up on about 8 occasions requiring a cold boot (unplugging the power cord) in order to reset.

"Wonderful tv. The con with this 55” is that when we are watching films, the static dark backgrounds have a wobbling motion.

"Excatly what was promised and what I expected from this product. Very good value for money ratio.
For that money a very good TV and it does not have to fear the comparison to other TVs which cost much more money.",B09ZLSRXRN,,,
"I was definitely hesitant given the reviews, but so far so good with one minor hiccup. I can't seem to get it to recognize my PC via HDMI. The PC recognizes the TV, the TV recognizes that something is plugged in, but it says no signal detected no matter what I've tried. Restarts, resets, plugging and unplugging, different cords, etc. I feel like I might be missing something simple.

That is not a dealbreaker, however, because it functions surprisingly well as a Smart TV. It's quick, no major delays or funkiness. Huge huge upgrade from the smart tvs of yesteryear, if that's holding anyone back. I've seen a lot of people complain about the ads, but they're confined to the home menu. You're not getting ads during Netflix or anything.

Overall I'm pretty pleased with this purchase, having paid about $250 out the door. I don't really need another computer monitor, so purely calling this a TV, it seems great, but longevity will be the true test.

Edit: Fixed the issue by setting the HDMI to 1.4 instead of 2.0 and it started working, but glitchy. Looks like it was a combination of that setting and a right-angle adapter I had on the pc end of the cable. Having changed those two things, it's now being used with my PC as well.",B09ZLSRXRN,,,
We love this TV. It is easy and has a great picture for its price.,B09ZLSRXRN,,,
"I found this during Prime Day, and got a hecka killer price. I wanted a Samsung, but alas its hard to find a 55"" Samsung model with all the features at a price I wanted.

I love the multiple HDMI hookups. You do not need a Firestick, so the one I have for my last TV is being used to hold papers down on my desk. The assembly was quick and easy. I am a senior and live alone so I was a bit worried that I might not be able to maneuver this out of the box and onto my TV stand, but I managed just fine. If you do unpack it alone, the easiest and safest thing to do is slide it out of the box onto your bed, hook up the legs [or stand if you go that direction], and hook up the power cord BEFORE you pick it up and put it down on the stand.

Wifi connection was a breeze, and the interface is just like the Firestick so its pretty easy to use and familiar to a veteran Firestick customer. Antenna driven TV was simple enough to add too, but I need to figure out if I can log into my Samsung account to get the on-air Samsung TV stuff.

"I bought the TV during Prime Days and picked up at Best Buy. The only thing I dislike is that the TV automatically shuts off when You pause a movie after only 15 minutes. When you turn the TV back on you are back on the home screen again and have to go back to the app such as Netflix and find the show you were watching and resume play. I went through ALL the setting to try and change it. This is not in the display or sleep settings. I called Insignia tech support and the lady I spoke with said that it is build into the TV to shut down if paused to save energy. ??? Why after only 15 minutes?

"HISENSE PROMO FRAUD UPDATE:

So I received a return shipping label for my TV return. However, the attached email states that the label is for a laptop return for a laptop purchased at Costco. I am returning a TV not a laptop. Also, I purchased the TV from Amazon not Costco. I am afraid to use the label since the email has the wrong purchase details. I am even more worried that Hisense is attempting to get out of its obligation, regarding the promotion and my return. I will now have to call customer service again on Monday, as they don't accept calls on the weekend. This will be the second time I have had to call, and it takes a long time to get through the automated phone response system. My advice - if you purchased a Hisense TV from Amazon under this so-called promotion, you have 30 days to return it to Amazon. After that, you are stuck with dealing with Hisense. Therefore, if you think you are not happy with the purchase, you should return it to Amazon within the 30 day return period and thereby avoid having to deal with Hisense.
WARNING: HISENSE PROMOTION FRAUD - I purchased this TV under the 100-Day Hisense Promotion. ""Try it for 100 days and return it if you don't love the TV"" Well I decided to return it because it has numerous problems, including audio problems, turning off by itself, etc. The return was approved by Hisense. I received a confirmation email stating that a return shipping label would be emailed to me within 5 business days. However, it has been five business days and I received no label. I called Hisense customer support and was told they are ""having a problem "" with their return shipping labels. I was told to wait another five days for a label, and if I haven't received a label by then, to call customer service. I don't know how they can have a ""problem"" that prevents them from issuing return shipping labels. I fully expect that I will not receive a label - again - and I will have to call back and they will have another excuse as to why they haven't provided me with a label. The time limit for returning the TV once the return is approved is 30 days. Can't very well return it with no return shipping label. I can foresee them using delay tactics until the time limit expires, and then they will refuse the return because it's outside the time limit. I should have known that this promotion was too good to be true. I have changed my review to 1 Star because of this issue.
UPDATE #2: I called HISENSE customer support about the return shipping label. They say the shipping label I received from them is the correct label and to call UPS to schedule a FREE pick up. The label is for UPS Ground service. However, UPS refuses to pick up the package. They insist that I must pay a $30 fee and I must have a UPS account so they can bill me for the pick up. Hisense insists that the pick up should be free. So here I am, caught in the middle. I have no way to get the TV to a UPS location. To say that I am upset and disappointed with this experience is an understatement. Hisense advertised the promotion as having easy returns, but it is anything but easy. Not sure what will happen next but I will have to call Hisense AGAIN (this will be the third time) to try and get this straightened out. I fear that I am going to be stuck with the TV (which has several issues). I may call Amazon, or file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, to see if they will accept a return. What a major headache and nightmare. I will never buy a Hisense product again, especially under a Hisense promotion.
TV Review: I received my brand new Hisense 65-inch U6H Model 65U6H HDTV today. This was sold and shipped by Amazon. The TV ships in it's original retail box, so no extra packaging to provide added protection during shipping. My U6H arrived with some damage to the outer box. The corner top of one side was damaged, and there was a puncture in the middle front of the box - right in the middle of where the TV screen would be. There was no obvious damage to the TV. Setup of the TV was quite easy. The legs fit perfectly into the base of the TV and each leg only requires two screws to secure to the TV. The screws went in easily and without issue. I was actually able to do the whole setup process myself, and I am a short 56 year old man. The TV is surprisingly light and I was able to lift it relatively easily by grasping it with one hand on the bottom beneath the screen and one hand to balance it on top. I was very impressed with how easy it was to get the TV out of the box. Just cut the three plastic straps, open the box, remove the styrofoam insert, an the outer box just slips right up and off. I was also impressed with the inner packaging. In particular, there were protective plastic shields on the sides of the TV, as well as plastic material all around the frame of TV which strips off easily. So as far as packaging, and the ease of physically setting up the TV, I would give it an A+.
I had no trouble plugging in the power cable to the back of the TV and turning it on. Immediately, the TV started the setup process, which I found to be easy and quick versus other TVs I have owned. I was easily able to connect to my WiFi, and tested out several different apps including Netflix, Amazon Prime, and YouTube. Everything happened quickly and smoothly - better than any TV I have used before. There were no glitches with lip sync while viewing content through apps - a problem I had previously with a Hisense TV. Overall, I would give the smart features another A+. Now, we get to the meat of it all - how does the TV perform.
My first immediate reaction was wow. I immediately tested the picture quality by watching an 8K Dolby Digital video on YouTube, and I found the colors to be super vivid and bright. In fact, I think the backlight was a little too much, as white colors came out totally indistinctly. However, I was easily able to adjust the backlight and picture settings using the remote. By the way, the remote seems to work very well - there is virtually no lag between pressing a button on the remote and seeing the TV respond.
Now is where we get into some problems. Yes, the colors are vivid, out of the box. As far as brightness is concerned, I found it exceptional. In fact, I had to dial back the brightness a bit. Mind you, I watch TV at night in a semi-darkened room. However, if there is an area where Hisense excels, it is in the brightness of it's panels. The U6H is no exception. Despite it's advertised relatively low peak brightness, something like 600 nits, I believe it is plenty bright enough for a large majority of consumers. Yes, you could go with a U8H or last years UHG, and get much greater brightness and backlighting. You also would pay considerably more. But in my opinion, the U6H will more than satisfy the majority of users when it comes to just peak brightness. If only brightness were the only issue.
Sadly - and I wanted to like this TV so much - there were problems right out of the box. First, the Hisense webpage for this TV advertises that it supports HDMI 2.1 on all of its HDMI ports. That is not true. I can confirm that it only supports 2.0. Period. If you are a gamer, this is a problem for you, as it is for me. And if you are a gamer, you know why. If you are not a gamer, you can skip the rest of this review, until the conclusion.
I bought this TV knowing that it is a 60 hertz panel. So I was prepared for that. I have my PC hooked up to this new U6H, using Windows 10, with an NVIDIA 3060ti graphics card. I am using a high quality, high speed HDMI cable, so my problems aren't the HDMI cable. The problem is, that this TV will not accept full 4K - in HDR - from a PC. It has a limited color gamut. It will not process 4.4.4 Chroma in 12-Bit or 10-Bit color at 60 Hz. In fact, it is limited to 4.2.0 Chroma at 60Hz in 8-bit color.
It will process RGB color from the PC - but again, only in 8-bit color. In short, you will not get more than 8-bit color from this TV when hooked up to a PC. This is depressing. I just sold a 2020 Vizio V-Series TV that I bought new for $250 on clearance, and it supported HDMI 2.1, as well as 4.4.4 Chroma
or RGB at 60 Hz, 12-bit color. Which leaves me asking myself, why did I buy this TV? It doesn't do what it is advertised to do - it doesn't process HDMI 2.1. It doesn't process more than 8-bit color when connected to a PC - like my old Vizio did - and to top it all off, the TV shut itself off within 1 hour of turning it on. This is exactly one of the problems that I had with the U8G - for which I was unable to get warranty support - they just wouldn't respond to my support requests. I finally had to return the TV because the return period was about to expire and nobody from Hisense had responded to my complaints. So...where does all of this leave us?
Should you buy a Hisense TV or not, and if so, should you go with the U6H? Well, I bought this 65 inch U6H after having a bad experience with the U8G that I had purchased - a bad experience with the TV and a bad experience with customer support. The thing is, I really want Hisense to succeed in it's mission - to bring high quality TVs to the public at a reasonable price. But I will say that I bought the U6H during a Hisense promotion - I have 100 days to try the TV and return it if I am not happy. So, I decided to give them one more chance to get it right. Right now, I'm not feeling very good about my purchase. I just wanted a TV that I wouldn't have problems with - I don't want to have to go through the whole warranty process, or the Amazon return process. But now it looks like I will have to go through it all again. In conclusion, there is something to be said for going with a more well-known brand like Sony, Samsung, or LG. You pay a little bit more at the outset, but in my experience it is worth the extra cost when it comes to overall quality and customer support. Another issue I would like to address is updates. I want my TV to update automatically. And I expect a new update to bring improvement, not make things worse. This is an area where Hisense lags. The last Hisense I bought, the U8G, had audio problems, and Hisense has yet to come out with an update to solve the issue, even though this is a problem going back a year or more. MY CONCLUSION: Hisense makes super bright panels. If brightness is your priority above all else, then yes, you will be happy with a Hisense U6H. But there is so much more that goes into buying a TV. For most people, buying a new TV is a major expense. Like me, they don't want to have to return a TV or try to get support from customer service for a TV that should just work as advertised, out of the box. Unfortunately, quality control and customer support are areas where Hisense fails miserably. I understand that some TVs come off of the assembly line with defects. What matters is, does the company stand behind it's product? In regard to Hisense, in my experience the answer is no. They do not stand behind their products. Accessing customer service for support or warranty service is difficult, and they do not respond to requests for help. This means that many people will be forced to return their Hisense TVs because they cannot get support before the return period runs out. Exactly what happened to me with the U8G. In closing, I would say this - buying a TV is like buying a car. You should buy the best you can afford at the time. The prices for Hisense TVs seem like a bargain - on paper. But I believe, based on my experience, that you will get what you pay for, and in the end the chances are pretty high that you will have problems with a new Hisense TV, and when you try to get help from the company, they will blow you off. You will then be stuck with a TV that doesn't do what it's advertised to do, from a company that doesn't stand behind it's products, wondering as I do - why did I sell my 2020 Vizio TV. UPDATE: So I was able to get the TV to accept Chroma 4.4.4 color from my PC by adjusting the settings in the NVIDIA control panel. However, I had to lower the refresh rate to 30Hz to get it to do it, and the color depth is still stuck at 8-bit color and ""Limited"" dynamic range. When I change the refresh rate to it's native 60Hz, the only color format available is Chroma 4.2.0 with ""Limited"" dynamic range. So no matter what you do, the TV only outputs the minimal 8-Bit color depth. I can also select RGB color format, which then allows for full dynamic range, but only if I change the refresh rate to 30Hz. So in summary, if you want the TV to run at it's native 60Hz, you are limited to Chroma 4.2.0 with 8-Bit color and limited dynamic range. To run RGB you will have to lower resolution to 30 HZ, and you will get full dynamic range but still only 8-Bit color. Or, you can run Chroma 4.4.4 at 30 Hz with limited dynamic range.
UPDATE: So a little while in, and I have some important updates regarding the 65-inch U6H that I purchased. First, there was a firmware update from Hisense which pushed through automatically. That was an improvement over the U8G that I had owned previously, so way to go Hisense. Also, the update seemed to do some good, as the TV is more stable, i.e. not turning off by itself so often. However, now the TV will not connect to my 5GHz WiFi - it connects for a moment and then disconnects. I'm forced to use 2.4GHz WiFi. It seems to work fine on 2.4 though. Also, this TV has trouble dealing with my Vizio M-Series soundbar. When I turn on the soundbar, the TV shuts off occasionally. At this point, I have to say that although the picture quality is pretty good, I would not pay full price for it, which right now is $598. It's just too glitchy. I paid $549, and if I keep it Hisense will give me $100. So for $449...yes I'd say it's worth it. But not $598.",B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
"UPDATE 11/02/22: I have since been invited to join Amazon's Vine programme. Rest assured, though, that I will always provide frank and updated feedback on all my reviews. This Hisense was actually bought by me, and my opinion is still that it's a gem.

First, let me preamble this review by saying a previous review of my 43” Hisense was the top review when I wrote it 5 years ago. That’s because I continually updated that review, and I intend on doing the same for this one, so please check back.

I give modern technology about 4 to 5 years (or, depending on price, 5-6) before I replace it for something better. That was the case with my old television, a Hisense which I bought for the Olympics that year. It was the first time I had ever heard of that brand, and honestly, I was wary. I’m not a fan of Chinese goods, since they’re built for affordability, not reliability. To my surprise, my old Hisense is as good as ever, and now a relative has inherited it, as the colours and 4K technology still hold up pretty well.

Nevertheless, I had been tempted by Amazon’s new affordable FireTV television. I pulled the trigger for their 55” Omni series, but almost immediately returned it. If you’ve never owned a 4K TV, that’s a good starter set. But the washed out colours and lack of features (no full array dimming, Quantum Dot, and HLG) made the return inevitable. So for 120 dollars more, I chose the 55” UH6 Hisense, which had tempted me with its instalment plans and dazzling features.

The second I turned on this Hisense, I knew it was a home run. POP POP POP. The hue! The brilliance of the whites! The deepest blacks! That’s what I had dreamt of all along, and I got it.

It has taken me a long time getting the settings just right. My old settings weren’t working as you can imagine, since the U6H offers so much more depth that one doesn’t need to yank up the contrast or brightness to get a good picture. In case this is of some help to you, here they are:

Picture
Backlight

Local Dimming High
Backlight Level 100
Automatic Sensor OFF

Picture Mode “Dolby Vision IQ”

CONTRAST 50
BRIGHTNESS 44
COLOR 55
TINT 0
SHARPNESS 10

Advanced Settings

Color Temperature LOW
Motion Enhancement OFF
Motion Clearness OFF
Noise Reduction HIGH
Digital Noise Reduction HIGH
HDMI Dynamic Range AUTO
Active Contrast HIGH
Color Space NATIVE
Low Blue Light OFF

I bought some 8K certified HDMI 2.1 cables for around 22 dollars (less on promotion), to be able to use it in the 2.1 slot to get the best audio and video. Just make sure that they are labelled “certified” for 2.1. Since it’s relatively new technology, the reviews can’t be more than 2 years old.

I also bought the new FireTV Cube, 2nd generation, to be able to get the most out of my new Hisense. It was half off during Prime Day, and I couldn’t have made a better co-purchase. The promotional addon 99 cent channels have really made it zing to its full potential. If you really want to enjoy your new set, though, you need to get one of the big boys: they have the most Dolby Atmos movies and series.

Having mentioned Dolby Atmos, here’s the only real negative about the Hisense. Its native speakers are excellent, but if you want the full Dolby Atmos experience, that immersive feeling you get in a theatre, you’ll need to buy a soundbar which decodes Dolby Atmos. That can run you from 400 to 900 dollars, new. My still very decent 5.1 Vizio soundbar doesn’t have Atmos, but it’s Dolby Digital Plus sound is brilliant all the same. It took me forever to figure out that you have to untick the CEC functionality, or else eARC will take over, and send the audio signals to my non-Atmos soundbar. If you want Atmos without a soundbar, you’ll have to make do with “TV Speakers”, until you buy one. To check it, head over to a major streaming service. If you see the precious double logo (Dolby Vision and Atmos), you hit the nail on the head. I suggest using the movie “Okja”, or “Black Panther” as your test movies for sound. The Atmos sound will blow you away.

DETAIL: If you don’t have a soundbar which decodes Dolby Atmos, you’ll need to use the Hisense’s own TV Speakers. Go to “Settings”, then, “Channels and Inputs”, then “Inputs”. Deselect ‘HDMI control’. You will now hear movies in Dolby Atmos. Otherwise, it’ll be decoded as Dolby Digital+.

I uploaded some photos for you to see the full range of colours you’ll get with the U6H. Check out a YouTube channels featuring animals. The wildlife videos are a joy to behold with your new set. The DETAIL. Incredible.

I’ll be adding to this review, as mentioned above, when I find anything which might help those considering buying it. Even one week in, I can tell you this is a no-brainer: buy it.

A similar set by Samsung with all the bells-and-whistles the Hisense U6H has would run you a cool thousand!",B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
"I wasn't sure how I'd like this Google TV, as I've generally leaned toward Amazon's Alexa.  I was intrigued by the features and price, so decided try it.  All I can say is WOW. 

Packaging was great - opened it up, and legs are right in the Styrofoam top padding, so you can't miss them!  Got help pulling it out of the box.  Couple screws to attach the legs, and it was ready to set up!  Will eventually mount on the wall, but wanted to make sure I liked it better than the Vizio I'm replacing.  Based on what I've seen the last few days, it'll get mounted this week! 

I wasn't sure what to expect for a ""Google Smart TV"".  I was absolutely surprised how easy this was to set up.  After powering it up, it walks you through step by step.  You connect it to your Google Home app (which I had to install).  It allows you to update settings on TV using your phone, or even use it as a remote.  Nice features and handy to have! It took longer to get set up compared to a Roku or Amazon device, but overall was smoother and more ""complete"". The other apps have you up and running quicker, but then you need to go into settings and add the apps. There's still some of that with this, but it covers the major subscription apps in bulk, so overall it saves time over the other systems. Like many other SmartTV's, logging into services can be done via phone or password.

What really impressed me was the Google TV features. I enabled Google access to the TV itself as prompted during the setup and trained it, speaking various sentences as prompted. Now I can say ""Hey Google, power on"", and the TV powers on.  Other commands work as well = ""Open Netflix"", or ""Play Survivor on Paramount"".  Of course volume control works too!  I really like that this is built into the TV - no need to use the remote or hold buttons.  I did find this seems to go to sleep, but I'm sure it's a setting to keep it active at all times.

As for TV itself, I love it!  Colors are vivid, bright, and clear.  There are plenty of HDMI ports, and they're clearly labeled.  Setup features for the TV itself are very easy to navigate. Loved the default picture, though in a darkened room was just a tad too bright.  Adjusting the picture is crazy simple - between the included 'modes', and the custom controls that can be applied to each, you can easily adjust for any lighting condition.  I'm impressed with the QLED display!

Sound quality also impressed me for this price point model. I've had to get sound bars for other TV's due to 'tinny' sound, but this has clear sound, and it's more than adequate for our room.

Overall, I'm really pleased with this 55"" Smart TV!  Easy setup, fantastic picture, great features and sound, and all at a great price. I can highly recommend!",B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
"this product is great for the price. I wished it was cheaper tho! haha. but let me tell you my experience about it. first of all the packaging was ok. it was easy to install. you need to screw two metal stands to the TV. the stands looks stable and firm. then you have to plug it in and that's it. it was easy and anyone can do it. specially it is light weight and can be handled by one person. during the setup you have to connect to wifi. the wifi search and finding it was really fast and easy. and then few steps to connect your gmail account to the TV and finally if you have accounts on Netflix Hulu and other channels you will enter your creditionals and it will be finalized. these steps are also really easy and fast. now it's time to go and see how is the screen quality. the screen is 4k and with this budget is one of the best options available. it uses quantum dot technology which helps you have wider range of colors. the Variable refresh rate has been improved and this option would be more pleasant if you are a person like me who plays video games a lot to be more smooth. the contrast ratio in this TV is one of my facorite aspects which is pretty great. this TV has a great quality in watching movies and shows. it can well handle reflections if you have a home which gets lots of light during the day like me. but keep in mind you cannot put the TV in front of a window that has direct light and expect this TV doesnt show the reflections!!! it can handle well lit room. next thing that might be important is sometimes you want to watch a movie from your collection and it has low quality like 480p. I tried it and surprisingly it upscaled it very well. the quality of 720 and 1080 upscaling is great which I expect every 4k TV do that but upscaling 480p is not easy I believe and I loved how it does. the borders are 1 cm and I consider it thin and I like as it is and the overall thickness is also around 8cm which I believe it is great for this price.
the last thing that I forgot to tell is the quality of remote control, the buttons are really smooth and soft. it works from distance and it responds to your commands really fast. overall I liked it. maybe if I want to mention its disadvantage with this price would be I would expect them to add HDMI 2.1 compared to U6G so the refresh rate could increase more but still its not noticeable. again with the money you are paying you cant expect it includes everything.",B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
"I am extremely satisfied and happy with this TV so far. Personally, think that its one of the best TVs for the price range.
1. Modern TVs have built in OS- this one is Google TV, which I like. The controller has a google assist button which is useful, but to be completely honest, I find myself using my apple TV most of the time (apple has been locked up in their “walled garden” lol). Nevertheless, have been impressed with Google TV: the apps that I use were in the app store, easy to use, responsive.
2. Picture quality- was expecting to picture quality to be lacking, but so far, picture quality has been superb. I use my TV to watch movies and shows, I don’t have a video game system connected to the TV so I can’t comment on how the picture looks while playing video games.
3. Sound quality- the previous television I owned, had poor sound quality, to the point I almost bought a sound bar. This TV- the sound quality has been superb. I have a small living room, but regardless of where I am in the living room, I could hear the sounds perfectly (sound is loud and rich).
4. Remote control- simple to use, not many bells and whistles. I primarily use my phone to control my TV, which is an option with this TV.
5. Packing- a saw a review that complained about the packing, I was worried too, but the TV arrived with no damage. The box I received was well padded and in great shape by the time I received it. It was delivered by a Prime truck, not sure if that makes a difference.

In summary- great TV for the price, awesome picture quality, great sound, ok remote control.",B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
" I bought the U6H 75 inch TV in late September, 2022. I am writing this review about 3 weeks later. I am very pleased with the purchase overall. I use the TV to watch movies, sports and TV shows. I am not a gamer, and I am not a TV tech expert. I bought the Hisense S214 soundbar to go with the TV, and I bought a ethernet to USB port adapter to use a wired port from my router to maximize speed. I plug it into the USD port and get about 300 megabits per second speed (the TV has USB 2.0 ports). I watch the TV with Theater Night mode with Motion Smoothing turned off.

For 4k (HDR) movies, it looks outstanding. The first movie I tested with is Thor Love and Thunder. The movie has bright color scenes, dark scenes and black and white scenes, so I think the movie is a good test for the TV. I was very pleased with it.

For sports - I played around with several modes, including Sports, Theater Day and Theater Night. My original plan was to have a Theater Day settings with motion smoothing for sports, and everything else as Theater Night, but I decided it wasn't worth the effort for me. I enjoyed watching sports on Theater Night mode without motion smoothing, so that is what I kept. 4k Sports are incredible (I have seen football and soccer on it). Regular sports - I think baseball looks best, followed by football.

I had not used Google TV before - I am used to the Fire TV, but I found it easy to use. The setup on the TV is easy if you have the Google Home app. I have YouTube TV, and that goes very well with the Google TV.

For sound, I use the HDMI ARC port to the Hisense soundbar. I use eARC and passthrough - it seems to sound better to me than the other options (Auto / PCM / Dolby Digital /Dolby Digital Plus). I don't have a Dolby Atmos soundbar so I can't comment on the Dolby Atmos feed from the TV. The CEC works well with the soundbar as I can turn the soundbar and TV on and off and change the volume with the TV remote.

Overall, this TV is a great value, especially when I got it on a discount and during their $100 gift card promotion.",B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
"The picture quality on this TV is amazing. I'm replacing a TCL 5 series 55"" from 2018 and there is no comparison. The Hisense 75"" blows the TCL away from a picture standpoint. I will say that the ROKU browser on the TCL is more intuitive than the Google TV on the Hisesnse, but I'm sure I'll get used to it.
The 75"" appears to have an IPS panel so the picture doesn't degrade at an angle, but unlike most IPS panels I've seen this TV is capable of nice deep rich blacks with minimal blooming. I'm honestly blown away by the picture quality at such a low cost.
The fact that this TV has Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, EARC and local dimming at $799 is amazing.
The sound quality from the set itself is okay but not great. It gets sufficiently loud but sounds a little hollow. I connected it to my Atmos capable sound bar and the EARC allows for complete passthrough of uncompressed Dolby Atmos and DTS and of course you can control the volume of the soundbar with the TV remote. The remote, once paired to the bluetooth allows you to control the TV without having to point the remote at the TV.
The build quality seems to be fine if nothing special.
Now for the small issues that to me aren't a deal breaker but are definitely a nuisance.
1. Out of the box the remote will not pair. To fix this do the firmware upgrade.
2. The remote Now app will not pair with the TV. This is a must to use with Alexa. I have not found a work around for this. I could see this being a deal breaker for some but I'm more concerned with picture Quality.
Bottom Line: For $799 I would say this is a no brainer despite a few small issues.
I've only had the TV for a few days so I'll try to update this if anything changes.
Update: After less than a month of use I've had to take the set back to factory start up 3 times for various issues and am about to do it a 4th time.
1st major issue the TV for no reason stopped communicating with the sound bar so no sound.'
2nd major issue is that the guide has never worked for live TV.
3rd major issue and this is the worst of all. The TV comes on loads up and once you select a program to watch it goes into a reboot loop. The only way I've found to fix this is by doing a full factory restart. Having to factory rest a new product 4 times in less than a month is simply unacceptable.
Update: 70 days in and Google tv has stabilized and is working somewhat better. I still like Roku better.
The program guide on antenna TV is still not working.",B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
"I've purchased 2 of these in the 75 inch size. 1 tv has been great. Love the Google TV interface, very easy to setup and sign into my streaming apps. Oddly Youtube TV is buried in the apps section and you have go to all apps and then hold the OK button down to reorder things so that the apps you want show up on the google tv main page. Picture is great for the price, especially since I am coming from an older LG Plasma that isn't 4k.

The second tv though... yikes. Screen was dead on arrival. Hisense sent out a tech after some excruciating support calls, but it took 1.5 weeks to get someone out here. Tech basically was like yeah they are going to have to replace it, so he took all the tv internals out of it and put a huge X through the panel and then left. It then took 3 weeks for another new tv to be shipped to me. This was supposed to white glove setup service so they could verify that it worked fine. Instead the delivery team (3rd party company) dropped it off and said all they could do was bring it right inside my door, even though the outside of the box said room of choice delivery, unpack, assemble base, power on and check. Called Hisense immediately and support told me to just check it myself. This is a 75 inch tv and was crazy to ask me to just do that myself. In any case, I did and when I plugged it in the wall it was immediately clear that the panel had damage. Called support back again and they basically said they need to escalate my case. So now I have 2 broken 75 inch tvs taking up space in my house and have no idea what I am supposed to do with them. Hoping that they actually get me another tv before my 100 day guarantee runs out HA, and take away the two broken tv's since you can't just put them out at the curb or fit it my car. Absolute nightmare trying to get a working tv and the support is awful to deal with. No updates ever, I just keep needing to call back in to see if someone can check on my case.

So if you buy one, just hope it works out of the box, if not be ready for a poor support experience.",B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
"My friend told me about this TV and since we had an old non smart tv in our bedroom, I decided it’s time for a new one. Very impressed with this one. Took me 5-10 minutes to set up and ready to watch. Really good looking TV and the sound is great too. Bright during the day and there are many picture settings you can choose from. I’m not really into TVs that much but just wanted something nice but nothing too fancy. Well, this seems very fancy and I love it so far! For the price you can’t beat it. I did a lot research and this one hands down had the best specs and reviews for my budget. I also love that it comes with Pluto TV which is basically free cable. I hadn’t had cable TV in 5 years so it’s nice to watch news when I wake up again. The remote has a Disney and Prime button besides Netflix, YouTube and Peacock which is nice. Overall, highly recommend.",B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
"I took a leap of faith with purchasing this TV from Hisense. I had seen the brand overseas but never used any of their products. However, I am pleasantly surprised with the quality of this TV. It is better than most well known brands for half the price. The picture sound, and features of this unit are stellar. The TV itself is sleek looking and very thin. I am happy with my purchase and will certainty consider this brand for other products in the future.",B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
"I purchased this 55” TV to replace a smaller 45” Roku TV that I had. This TV uses a Google Smart remote so it was different than the Roku I am used to, but I really like it. I’m a big fan of Google so I like that I am able to connect my account to everything on the TV. The set up is pretty straightforward by just following all the prompts on the screen. The color is beautiful and the quality is amazing. It comes with legs to stand it up but I just put it up on my wall where the old TV was. It’s a pretty big television so it’s a little heavy but not too much. I’m a tiny person and I was able to lift it up with my teenager. So far I’m pretty happy with the way it operates and the picture quality. I can’t really speak for the longevity of this device since I’ve only had it a few days, but I’ll update in the future as I get more use out of it. But it’s great as of now!",B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
"Hisense 65U6H review.
Bought this because of price and value, and because of positive reviews elsewhere. The two-year factory warranty also played a large role.
Took me a little over week to get it adjusted to the point where I can say it’s awesome.
I worked in broadcast TV engineering for a lot of my career, and am amazed at where video technology is today. One of the bittersweet things is the ability to adjust specific parameters.
Original main concerns were lack of ""texture"" and sharpness.
Got about 95% of the way to awesome via adjustments.
The thing that put it over the top to get to awesome was setting my Series 3 HD TiVo to ""native"" for the HDMI output. Now the Hisense TV does the correct video processing, and is not fighting with and dealing with the TiVo output. Plus the Hisense processing and conversion is 14 year newer technology.
There’s a lot of interaction between settings. Be patient. Make smaller adjustments, and you’ll likely reach a great picture.
Out of the box —- No DSE. Screen consistency is as perfect as I’ve ever seen. No dead pixels.
We use it mostly to watch television via cable, antenna and streaming.",B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
"We have had the 75"" set for nearly a month and we are very happy with the picture quality and performance so far.

This unit has an IPS panel vs. the VA panel that is reported on the smaller TVs of the same model. For us, that is not a problem as we rarely watch the set in complete darkness and the wider viewing angle works is a greater benefit. In complete darkness and with dark scenes, the back lighting is visible in the dark areas, but I really cannot say whether it is better or worse than a comparable VA unit - it's much better than our previous 8-10 year old TV (JVC BC50R).

Color reproduction is really great out of the box and we only did a minor amount of tweaking to our liking on top of the ""Theater Day"" mode. When not gaming, we have motion enhancement set to ""Film"" and it does enough to keep a natural look on anything we are watching. Motion enhancement turns off automatically if you have a video game console connected (PS4, Switch in our case), but it did not detect games started on our HTPC, and had to be turned off manually. To get the best color reproduction from your consoles, it's best to enable HDR and Full Range color on the console, then set the TV's ""HDMI Dynamic Range"" to ""Auto"" and ""Color Space"" to ""Native"". Setting ""Color Space"" to ""Auto"" seems to sometimes pick the wrong setting and your TV's color reproduction will be off from what the console is outputting.",B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
" I bought a Hisense TV for my garage, as you can see it hanging on the wall. (I watch TV while I'm detailing my bike or working on other projects.) I liked it so much that when it came time to replace the TV in the living room, I went with Hisense again. I was not disappointed!

The Hisense new 'Quantum ULED' has a picture that is better than any other TV at this price point. (I did a lot of research.) The blacks are REALLY black. (I like this for the perceived depth of field.) The colors are super vivid and there are no breaks in gradient, like other TV's in this class. (There are no 'bands' in contrast from light to dark.) The images are crisp and clearly defined. I watch a lot of 4K streaming and the visual experience with this TV is fantastic.

It's internet ready and I had no problems connecting it to my home network. It works very well with Alexa. I also like that I have one button access to Prime Video and Netflix. My wife and I like movies and not having to deal with multiple remotes for that is very nice. The voice command feature is convenient and is a lot easier than scrolling through multiple commands using buttons.

It has all the wiring connections you could want, to hook it up to your home theater system. I used them all and the sound is fantastic.

There is no way that the video I attached to this review can show you how great the quality of this Hisense TV is. But, I hope you get the idea. It's really, really great. I'm happy with this purchase.",B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
Love this tv. Wanted to get an OLED type like my son in law bought because the picture was stunning. But alas it was out of my price range. Honestly when we set up this TV my husband and I were both elated to see a brilliant picture. This tv looks just as good as the super high priced TV. It's a great purchase.,B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
"Love the tv. Looks good. Picture is bright and very clear. 4k smart tv looks amazing. The photos attached don’t do the tv justice. Sound is good with different settings for various shows/sports. Good price and value for all the features.

Google tv is already on the tv along with preset buttons for channel selection. Don’t need to add Amazon Firestick to this one. Way better than our old LED tv. It was packaged well with no damage.

The remote is easy to see with my old eyes. There are buttons for Netflix, Prime video, YouTube, Disney, Tubi, and Peacock. There is a button for Google assistant also.

The 55” tv is the perfect size in my opinion. The 4k is beautiful when it is available. The picture is great and the remote is easy to use. I am very happy with this purchase. If my opinion of this tv changes, I will update this review.",B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
"The picture on this TV is great! I would recommend, but everyone should know the TV speakers is nothing to brag about. I also wanted people to know that for some reason Disney + and Amazon Prime on this TV (the app) display the ATMOS but does not pass it. Netflix and others passes ATMOS without an issue, overall I think this TV is worth the upgrade for me. I had issues with the remote turned out I had to turn off the bluetooth on it now it seems good!",B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
"The color is good with this 55"" U6H, but it is really comes to LIFE when watching HDR or Dolby content. When watching such content it gets BRIGHT all in the correct places. I recommend setting the PICTURE CONTROLS to ""Theater Day"" or ""Filmmaker Mode"" try both and see what you like. Under Picture Advanced Settings: set color temperature to LOW and Filmmaker Mode Auto Detection to ON, Active Contrast to HIGH, HDMI Dynamic Range to Auto, and ""all"" Motion and Noise Reduction settings to OFF. I also like the TINT set to R3. Sound for this TV is okay for just everyday tv viewing, but add an AV Receiver with good speakers and this will turn your living room into a movie theater, or maybe a good sound bar would help as well. I recommend this tv and wish I would have gone with the 65"" size.",B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
I was looking for a new 4k TV for my bedroom to replace my old one. I have heard both good and bad things about Hisense and figured I'd give it a shot. The TV was easy to setup and I love it! The picture is great and it's bright. I was lucky to not have any damages from shipping which I see is an issue so that was good. I'm glad I went with this TV!,B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
"I found this Hisense budget-friendly 4K ULED Smart TV on sale and couldn't resist the price. Although it's the entry-level model in Hisense's ULED (Quantum Dot) lineup, it's the latest 2022 version so it has some surprising specs.

Although this is a budget friendly TV, it supports Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos cinema technology.

Native 4K content looks great. It has a variable refresh rate up to 60Hz and a motion rate of 240Hz. It also upscales lower resolution content and supports HDR content.

The Google TV user interface is very responsive. Google TV provides access to more native applications (via the Google Play Store) than any other Smart TV OS interface. Connect to the internet via the built-in ethernet port or by using the built-in WiFi (802.11ac).",B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
"Good TV, excellent for the price. My biggest complaint is the sound quality",B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
"I won't pretend to be a technical TV guy, plenty of others around here for that, but this was a huge step up from my aging Samsung plasma TV. Brightness and the blacks are what stand out for me and calibration was straight forward. At this price point, as long as it works as intended on arrival, I can't imagine this unit would disappoint.",B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
"This tv has decent color and can get very bright, depending on the setting selected. I am not a fan of the control because it is small and rounded in the back, which makes it difficult to handle.

However, my biggest problem is with the television's ability to display YouTube, Netflix, and Disney. The image always shows up tiled/pixelated. You literally see a bunch of pixels. However, when I went into the tv's internet browser and loaded up YouTube, it shows the picture just fine. Also, if I plug in a fire stick, the picture shows up clear as well.

I spoke with several HISENSE reps, on their chat, and they weren't really helpful. They kept blaming my internet speed. It doesn't make sense that a firestick, using the same internet connection, can display a clear picture, but the actual tv is not able to. Even the tv's internet browser displays YouTube videos, but the actual HISENSE YouTube app does not.

I've tried turning off all the extra settings, with no success. The tv is only usable if you have a streaming device because the native apps have some issues and don't work properly. I really wanted everything on the tv to work properly so I wouldn't have to use two controllers at the same (one for the tv and one for the firestick)",B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
"Good picture quality, bright colors overall satisfied and it fits Hisense's $100 cash back, downsides are weak sound and not enough viewing angles",B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
"Picture seems fine for me, I'm not an expert. I'm also not an audiophile but I had to purchase a separate sound bar since he sound was quite bad, hence, the 4 stars.",B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
The picture quality is pretty good for the price. The only thing to not is there is slight blooming around text and objects on super dark or black backgrounds. It’s definitely better than other TVs in this price range. I would definitely buy again for a main streaming/Netflix tv.,B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
Great price and great picture... blows away the previous TV. Very happy with this purchase,B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
"Bought this for my home and is actually easier to use than my other TV. Good picture quality and easy to navigate. Good value. Right out of the box great pic great tv sound. So far so good.
The colors are vivid and bright the sound is great like a movie theater experience, if you want a great tv without the high price this is the one great quality give the big brand a run for the money, the edges are thin so more screen.",B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
For the price this is an excellent tv with a really good HDR for it's price point.,B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
"How can this happened? I received the tv with no power cable to plug it to the outlet, no remote control and manual (which can be downloaded, but still). I don’t care about the manual but no control and no cable plug?

Edit: I called Hisense customer service and they were able to FedEx the cable plug and remote. And after further inspection of the tv it turns out they did not include the screws to screw in the tv legs, which was not a big deal since I mounted it in the wall.

As for the TV it is amazing and I would really recommend it.",B09YVTQ7JJ,,,
